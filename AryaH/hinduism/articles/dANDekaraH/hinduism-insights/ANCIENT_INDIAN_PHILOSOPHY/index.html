<p>A talki on ancient Indian philosophy. may very well be prefaced with a brief statement of the main features which dis. tinguish it from the philosophies of other peoples Unlike many other philosophical systems, Indian philosophy is not merely a system of thought It is essentially a system of life Mere intel. lectual comprehension of the ultimate reality has never been the goal of Indian philosophers, they have always aimed at the spiritual realisation of that reality Indian thinkers, in other words, have always striven to&rsquo;live&rsquo; philosophy, rather than merely to learn and teachit Ancient Sanskrit writers have used a very significant word to denote a system of philosophy, namely, darśana, which means immediate vision of the ultimate reality as against its mediate knowledge
Secondly, most of the philosophical systems of ancient India claim to be mainly based on the Veda Among the valid means of knowledge, therefore, authority of the Veda is invariably placed over and above sensual perception and inference Later on, however, some rationalists did question the absolute validity of the Veda and also openly flouted its authority The philosophical systems in ancient India consequently fall into two categories - the ăstika or orthodox (that is, those which accept the absolute validity of the Veda) and the näsnika or heterodor (that is, those which do not recognise any such claim for the Veda ) The orthodox systems asserted that human sease-organs and human intellect are necessarily limited in scope and power They would, therefore, certainly fail to comprehend the all-com prehensive ultimate reality The teacher of the Taittiriya-Upa

nisad has described the ultimate reality as that wherefrom words turn back, together with the mind, not having attained it.* The ultimate reality is thus indeterminable ercept by means of a human faculty which transcends the senses and the intellect namely, intuition And the Veda is the most perfect expression of the intuitional vision of the ancient seers The faith of the Indian thinkers in the absolute validity of the Veda must not, therefore, be construed as an admission of defeat on their part It rather represents a sort of epistemological optimism, which overcomes the otherwise contingent indeterminism
Just as Indian philosophy transcends, in this manner, the realm of logic, it also transcends the realm of ethics Ultimate philosophy, it is averred, must not be governed by the values of this phenomenal world, which determine ethical conduct and which are necessarily relative and got absolute Indian philo sophy is accordiogly not mere intellectualism nor mere moral ism And yet, paradoxical as it may seem, ancient Indian philosophy has never retaaided an 150lated phenomenon in social history In India, philosophy and social development have influenced each other with very positive results It may, however, be remembered, in this connection, that, though ancient India has produced a variety of pbilosophical systems, they are all marked by a peculiar unity of purpose Sach unity in diversity is, indeed, an outstanding feature of the entire Indian culture Unlike most European philosophical systems, Indian philosophical systems, be it further doted, are not known after individual philosophers It is, therefore, possible to trace the development of philosophical thought in ancient India without any reference to personalities
It 15 customary to discover the origin of the entire ancient Indian thought and practice in the Veda. Such a view, however, is not altogether correct For, doctrines like those of Yoga and atomism, which became prominent in some later philosophucal systems, seem to have been almost unknown to the early Veda It

is, therefore, necessary to trace them to a source other than the Vedic Aryan Some indications of these - particularly of Yoga - are now fortunately brought to light through the archaeological discoveries in the Indus valley Indian philosophy - both ortho dox and heterodox- must, therefore, be said to have been the result of the interaction of two principal currents of thought - the pre-Vedic indigenous Indian current of thought and the Vedic Aryan current of thought In view of the paucity of material re garding the former, however, we have to begin with the Veda
The earliest Vedic texts, namely, the Rgreda and the Atharva reda, are, broadly speaking, collections of prayers and magical incantations respectively of philosophy, in the strictest sense of the term, we find in them but vague beginnings They rather represent the two types of religion - the Rgieda, which is a collec tion of hymns and prayers employed 10 Dature-worship, fire worship, hero-worship, and the Soma cult represents the religion of the classes,&rsquo; while the Athanaveda which contains incantations and formulas of magic and witchcraft, represents the religion of the masses * among the Vedic Indians After a long and stredu ous period of conquest and colonisation, the Vedic Aryans finally settled down in the fertile land of the seven rivers&rsquo; and beyond
They soon felt secure and established fairly prosperous tribal principalities This change in their way of life ellected a change also in their religious outlook and practice in their newly. acquired prosperity and leisure, their simple religion came to be elaborated into a complicated system of ritual And, in course of time, the formal details of this ritual became so very complex that a new well organized class of priests, who alone could master those details, arose in the Vedic society As was expected, o order to serve their own end, these priests, soon enough, elevated sacrifice from being a means to an end to being an end in itself
The total result of all this was threefold Firstly, the spirit of religion was neglected and emphasis came to be placed on its mere form Secondly, since all this was being done in the name of the Veda, an attitude of blind acceptance was deliberately fostered among the common people so that they would ungues.

tioningly accept the interpretation which the priests chose to foist on the Veda And lastly, one class, namely, the priestly class, secured domination over other classes in the society
In a sense, this updue eraltation of sacrifice must be said to have prepared the way for the rise of the truly philosophical speculations 11 ancient India For, the mechanical ritualism sponsored by the Brāhmana texts had its devitable reaction in the form of a two-fold revolt-intellectual and social The yanguards of this revolt nere the teachers of the early Upanisads They raised the banner of free thinking, and encouraged, among the people, an attitude of inquiry They proclaimed that the spirit was more essential than the form And they showed that religion and philosophy Deed oot be the monopoly of any one class
The Uponisads, which, as the word denotes, contain the teachings imparted by a teacher to an esoteric group of pupils, represent the proper beginnings of ancient lodian phưosophical thought For, they deal, more or less exclusively, with the four problems of philosophy - namely those concerning the world, the man, the ultimate reahty, and the mutual relatonship of these three The thiplers of the Upanisads who, be it goted, came from all classes of society, argued empirically like this Jast as the vanous utensils made of clay can be ultimately reduced to one single source, namely, clay, and just as the essential reality underlying those various ateosıls like pitcher, plate, etc is clay, - the pitcher, the plate, etc being mere names and forms -Sim: larly this manifold phenomenal world can be reduced to one siagle ulumate principle, which is called Brahman, and this Brahman is the essential reality underlying the phenomenal world - the phenomenal sorld itself being merely a bundle of pames and forts, and therefore, essentially unreal The Upa nisadıc thinkers also analysed the human persorality Human personality, according to their fir dings was made up of five sheaths (lošas) - cach succeeding sheath lying within the preceding one and, therefore, being more real and essential than the latter These five sheaths are the physical, the vital, the

mental, the intellectual, and the blissful, which last they identified with the soul. It is this last and innermost sheath, pamely, the soul or Ātman, which is the true essence of man It was then but the natural next step for the Upanısads to identify Brabman, the essential reality in the cosmic world, with Atman, the essential reality in man. Though the Upamsads present - and naturally enough - quite a variety of teachings, this doctrine of monistic idealism may, for all practical purposes, be regarded as their most representative teaching Under the spell of audja or pescience, man forgets his true nature and gets involved in this phenomepal world, believing it to be rea] It is, therefore, the aim of pbilosophy to make man realise his essential oneness with the ultimate reality and thus help him to get released from the Samsāra
The religio philosophical thought of the Veda has thus developed through the three logically-as well as chronologically successive stages of the mythology and the magic of the Rgreda and the Athanaveda, the mechanical ritualism of the Brāhmanas, and the monistic idealism of the Upanisads On account of the freshness of their outlook and the profundity of their thought, the Upapasadıc thinkers have left an indelible mark on Indian philosophy As a matter of fact, the Upanısads are regarded, and rightly so, as one of the three foundations on which the noble edifice of Indian philosophy is raised But in the history of ancient Indian philosophy, there came a time when the Upanışadıc thought lost much of its influence This was due to the methods adopted by the Upanisadıc teachers rather than to any intrinsic short comings of their speculations For one thing, the Upanisadıc teachers did pot bother about the process of thought - they oply gave the results and conclusions without their logical background In other words, their method was intuitional, and their appeal mystical This was surely beyond the common man Moreover the essentially individualistic attitude of the Upadisadic teachers, the apparent lack of uniformity in their teachings, and their near

rejection of this world were also responsible for the fact that the Upanisads did not take deep roots among the people at large
presuppose some kind of religion often fails to appeal to the popular mind,
This failure of the early Upan, sads resulted in a spurt, of a sort, of the heterodos systems of thought, like Buddhism and Jainism, which, incidentally, had their roots in the pre-Vedic thought-complex They took advantage of the intellectual atmos phere created by the Upani sads - particularly ther refusal blindly to accept the authonty of the Veda -as also of the philosophical and religious democracy envisaged by them At the same time, they avoided the obvious weak points of the Upan15adic methods Consequently these two, more especially Boddhism, became strong antı-Vedic forces, so much so that, on account of their onslaught, the Vedic way of life and thought was seriously jeopardized In the development of the orthodox philosophical thought there thus ensued a kind of interregnum
But the spark kindled by the Vedas and the Upanisads was not altogether extinguished There still were a large oumber of partisans of the Veda who bravely followed in the trail so finely blazed by their ancestors They started a comprehensive moves ment for consolidating, systematising, and popularising the Vedic
way of life and thought One aspect of this great movement related to the orthodox philosophy This latter now came to be properly organised in the form of six systems in a manner more methodical than the Upanisads, these systems dealt with all the outstanding problems of philosophy They made abundant use of logical reasoning They became at once critical and construc tive In short, with the systems, Indian philosophy became truly self-consciODS
5 It is true that Indian philosophy often characterised as rel.gious mysticism&quot; However, what u coded to be suggested here is that people are generally more amenable to some kind of religious practice than to more philosophical contemplation.

INSIGIITS INTO HINDUISM
Though all the six systems claim to owe allegiance to the Veda, only two of them, pamely, the Pūrvamimāmsi of Jarming and the Uttaramināmsī or Vedānta of Bādarāyana, can be said to be directly based on Vedic scriptures, whereas the remaining four, namely, the Sāmkhya of Kapıla, the Yoga of Patañjali, the Vaišesika of Kanāda, and the Nyāya of Gautama, were only indirectly, and, 10 many ceses, in a forced manner, connected with the Veda It must, all the same, be remembered that there are several common points in all these systems - such as, for instance, the Karma theory, the doctrine of the soul, and the doctrine of moksa Another point to be noted about these systems is that all of them cannot be said to be philosophical systems proper The Purvamimīms, is mainly a methodology of interpretation of scriptural texts, the Yoga teaches physical, mental, and spiritual discipline, and the Nyāya is a system of epistemology and logic The truly metaphysical systems are the Vedānta, the Samkhya, and the Vaisesika
The Vedānta aims at establishing a harmony among the apparently inconsistent and self-contradictory Upanisadıc teach 10gs This it does by positing two points of view, the păramár thika (absolute) point of view and the vjāvadārika (relative) point of view it sets forth the Brahman Atman identity as the absolute reality, and the phenomenal world as being only relati vely real On account of insufficient light, a rope appears like a serpent, which it really is not When, however, a light is brought forth, the rope presents itself in its true nature Simi larly, as soon as true knowledge dawns, the phenomenal world vanishes, and the individual soul realises its identity with the cosmic self thus regaining its origioal character
The Samkhya teaches a metaphysical dualism It enunciates two cternal independent entities, the Prakrti and the Purusa The Praksti (or matter ) represents the state of equipoise of the three gunas - sattva, rajas, and tamas The Praktı is 10sentient but
6 Thesc six systems are not inaptly - called systems of salvation DASHIAM, The II onder that was India, 1971, 325 ff

possesses the capacity to undergo modificaton The Purusa (or the soul), on the other hand, is sentiept but immune from any kind of modification By some chance, the Parusa and the Praktı come in contact with each other And, as the result of the seeing&rsquo; on the part of the Purasa, the state of equipoise represented by the Prakrti is disturbed and the process of the evolution of the universe starts Apart from the dualism, another feature, which distinguishes the Samkhya from the Vedānta, is its realism
The Varsesikas also are realists, they have propounded the doctrine of atomic pluralisro Their method is analytical and they have brought metaphysics closer to physics Accordmg to them, in the beginning, there existed an infinite cumber of atoms, subtle and incomprebersible by buman sens organs, each atom being distmguishable from the other, and each possessing some specific quality As the result of some initial urge, these afons began to move and formed different physical combinations The atoms, possessing the quality of odour for instance, were thus grouped together and the earth was created. In this manner, the four elements ne into being, and, out of tben, this mani. fold ponerse Side by side with the plurality of atoms, the Varesikas also assume the existence of a plurality of souls Incidentally, it 15 forth noting that in their early forms, the three metaphysical systems, namely, the Vedānta tbe Simkhya, and the Vanesika were &lsquo;godless systems of thought
The philosophy of the systems later on developed in two directions - each developmert in its owo way, inaugurating a glorious epoch in the history of lodian philosophy The first development was in the direction of a popular synthesis of these systems - the best representarse of such a synthesis being the Bhagavadgitā The second developmert was in the direction of scholastic elaboration of these systems, to which rich contributions have been made by the best brairs of medieval India
