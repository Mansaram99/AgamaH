Let&amp;rsquo;s start with Airyama-ishyô. It comes in ardibehisht yacht, whose efficacy was eloquently vouched by a Parsi acquaintance long back. He narrated an incident where his sickness due to nazar was cured by a ritual where this manthra is recited and peacock feather is stroked over his body. The recovery was remarkable.</description>

My father-in-law&amp;rsquo;s father (PVK/Shabdam?-Vangipuram/Bharadvaja settled in Tirumalai and traditionally sishyas of a Tirupati-Swamy) apparently had some similar siddhi in snakebite-venom removal. My FIL had observed him do it a few times in his childhood. Unfortunately he had passed away by the time my FIL was 10 or so. So other than witnessing the event, my FIL didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about it.</description>

There was this vaidika and a vidvān. He had a set of students learning śruti from him. All of a sudden, one of his student went incommunicado. The vaidika paid him a visit. It turned out the student developed white kuṣṭha and became depressed. Medications weren&amp;rsquo;t working.. It was so worse that he quit his job and rarely came out of his room. The student asked &amp;ldquo;Guruji, you often say śruti has solutions for laukika problems.</description>
