Thembirai Andavan The current pontiff (2021) of Andavan Ashramam is the 12th. The 7th pontiff known as Thembirai Andavan in his old age had was advise to undergo a surgical procedure to remove a growth on his chest that was the size of a fist. It was present for a long time but had recently become painful.
