A friend once contacted us regarding a problem his friend was facing. The problem was an acute abhichāra that was on-going. The guy already had close brush with death twice in that week. He was so shaken up that he practically locked himself in that room.
His vaiṣṇava guru was traveling and uncontactable. He should have listened to his guru and performed the puraścharaṇa of +++(hayagrIva)+++ mantras given to him a year back.</description>

A relative a govt official was being harassed by goons. From a distance people from the siddheshvarI-pIThaM(?)noticed this and remarked: Dont you need weapons to defend against such? They did not give any mantra but a dhyAna shloka &amp;amp;chitra paTa with yantra. Results were very good. This was narrated to me when I noticed a bagalA chitra paTa in their pUja room and asked about it during a visit.</description>
