      <description>from: kw841 provenance: first hand account
one first hand tale someone I know did not beget children given his secular outlook he went to doctors and specialists upon all the tests &amp;amp; wait for 4 yrs was told it&amp;rsquo;s unexplained infertality nothing can be done hence recommended IUI/ IVF.
however he had learned rudra as child. so was recommended to do rudra abhisheka starting with sadyojata to Ishana mantras. because of his ego he made a challenge with me &amp;amp; others that he will do this for 48 days &amp;amp; only if get pregnant within 3 months will ascribe this to these actions other wise coincidence.</description>

provenance: first hand account
My relative was childless for 12 years. A mantravid from chera regions prepared an oshadhi for them. The couple observed a vrata to santānagopālaka, performed the japa as per instructions, finishing with homa. They had a child shortly. I learned vidyāgopālaka mantras from him.</description>
