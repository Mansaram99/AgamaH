      <description>Now the Reverend Bādarāyaṇa declares his own view, which constitutes the final conclusion in this matter.
Those not depending on symbols he leads, thus Bādarāyaṇa thinks; there being a defect in both cases; and he whose thought is that. Bādarāyaṇa is of opinion that the deities lead those not depending on symbols, i.e. all meditating devotees other than those depending on symbols. That is to say. the view that those are led who meditate on the effected Brahman cannot be upheld; nor is there an exclusive rule that those only should be led on who meditate on the highest Brahman.</description>
