      <description>The abode of heaven, earth, &amp;amp;c. (is the highest Self), on account of terms which are its own. The followers of the Atharva-veda have the following text, &amp;lsquo;He in whom the heaven, the earth and the sky are woven, the mind also, with all the vital airs, know him alone as the Self, and leave off other words; he is the bank (setu) of the Immortal&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. II, 2, 5).</description>

      <description>If it be said that some (mention) that which rests on Inference; we deny this because (the form) refers to what is contained in the simile of the body; and (this the text) shows. So far the Sūtras have given instruction about a Brahman, the enquiry into which serves as a means to obtain what is the highest good of man, viz. final release; which is the cause of the origination, and so on, of the world; which differs in nature from all non-sentient things such as the Pradhāna, and from all intelligent beings whether in the state of bondage or of release; which is free from all shadow of imperfection; which is all knowing, all powerful, has the power of realising all its purposes, comprises within itself all blessed qualities, is the inner Self of all, and possesses unbounded power and might.</description>

      <description>To this the next Sūtra replies&amp;ndash;
(Matter in its subtle state) subserves an end, on account of its dependence on him (viz. the Supreme Person). Matter in its subtle state subserves ends, in so far only as it is dependent on the Supreme Person who is the cause of all. We by no means wish to deny unevolved matter and all its effects in themselves, but in so far only as they are maintained not to have their Self in the Supreme Person.</description>

      <description>If it be said that there would result the fault of there being no room for (certain) Smr̥tis: (we reply) &amp;rsquo;no,&amp;rsquo; because there would result the fault of want of room for other Smr̥tis. The first adhyāya has established the truth that what the Vedānta-texts teach is a Supreme Brahman, which is something different as well from non-sentient matter known through the ordinary means of proof, viz. Perception and so on, as from the intelligent souls whether connected with or separated from matter; which is free from even a shadow of imperfection of any kind; which is an ocean as it were of auspicious qualities and so on; which is the sole cause of the entire Universe; which constitutes the inner Self of all things.</description>

      <description>Not that which is inferred, on account of the impossibility of construction, and on account of activity. The Sūtras have so far set forth the doctrine that the highest Brahman is the cause of the origination and so on of the world, and have refuted the objections raised by others. They now, in order to safeguard their own position, proceed to demolish the positions held by those very adversaries. For otherwise it might happen that some slow-witted persons, unaware of those other views resting on mere fallacious arguments, would imagine them possibly to be authoritative, and hence might be somewhat shaken in their belief in the Vedic doctrine.</description>

      <description>Not Ether; on account of the absence of scriptural statement. We have demonstrated that the Sānkhya-system and other systems standing outside the Veda are untenable since they rest on fallacious reasoning and are self-contradictory. In order to prove that our own view is altogether free from all objections of this kind, we shall now explain in detail the mode in which this world, with all its sentient and non-sentient beings, is produced by Brahman, whom we hold to be the general creator.</description>

      <description>Thus the prāṇas. After having taught that Ether and all the other elements are effects, and hence have originated, the Sūtras had shown that the individual soul, although likewise an effect, does not originate in the sense of undergoing a change of essential nature; and had in connexion therewith clearly set forth wherein the essential nature of the soul consists. They now proceed to elucidate the question as to the origination of the instruments of the individual soul, viz.</description>

      <description>In obtaining another of that, it goes enveloped, (as appears) from question and explanation. That the Vedānta-texts establish as the proper object of meditation, on the part of all men desirous of Release, the highest Brahman, which is the only cause of the entire world, which is not touched by even a shadow of imperfection, which is an ocean, as it were, of supremely exalted qualities, and which totally differs in nature from all other beings&amp;ndash;this is the point proved in the two previous adhyāyas; there being given at the same time arguments to disprove the objections raised against the Vedānta doctrine on the basis of Smr̥ti and reasoning, to refute the views held by other schools, to show that the different Vedānta-texts do not contradict each other, and to prove that the Self is the object of activities (enjoined in injunctions of meditation, and so on).</description>

      <description>In the intermediate sphere the creation (is effected by the soul); for (Scripture) says (so). So far it has been shown that the soul in the waking state suffers affliction since, in accordance with its deeds, it goes, returns, is born, and so on. Next an enquiry is instituted into its condition in the state of dream. With reference to the state of dreaming Scripture says, &amp;lsquo;There are no chariots in that state, no horses, no roads; then he creates chariots, horses and roads.</description>

      <description>What is understood from all the Vedānta-texts (is one), on account of the non-difference of injunction and the rest. The Sūtras have stated whatever has to be stated to the end of rousing the desire of meditation-concluding with the fact that Brahman bestows rewards. Next the question is introduced whether the vidyās (i.e. the different forms of meditation on Brahman which the Vedānta-texts enjoin) are different or non-different, on the decision of which question it will depend whether the qualities attributed to Brahman in those vidyās are to be comprised in one act of meditation or not.</description>

      <description>The benefit to man results from thence, on account of scriptural statement; thus Bādarāyaṇa thinks. We have concluded the investigation into the oneness or diverseness of meditations&amp;ndash;the result of which is to indicate in which cases the special points mentioned in several meditations have to be combined, and in which not. A further point now to be investigated is whether that advantage to the meditating devotee, which is held to accrue to him from the meditation, results from the meditation directly, or from works of which the meditations are subordinate members.</description>

      <description>Repetition, on account of the text teaching (what has to be done more than once). The third adhyāya was concerned with the consideration of meditation, together with its means. The Sūtras now enter on a consideration of the results of meditation, after a further preliminary clearing up of the nature of meditation. The question here arises whether the act of knowledge of Brahman inculcated in Vedānta-texts, such as &amp;lsquo;He who knows Brahman reaches the Highest,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Having known him thus he passes beyond death,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;He knows Brahman, he becomes Brahman,&amp;rsquo; is, in the view of Scripture, to be performed once only, or to be repeated more than once.</description>

      <description>Speech with mind, on account of this being seen and of scriptural statement. The Sūtras now begin an enquiry into the mode of the going to Brahman of him who knows. At first the soul&amp;rsquo;s departure from the body is considered. On this point we have the text, &amp;lsquo;When a man departs from hence his speech is combined (sampadyate) with his mind, his mind with his breath, his breath with fire, fire with the highest deity&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ.</description>

      <description>On the path beginning with light, that being known. The Sūtras now go on to determine the road which the soul of the wise man follows, after having&amp;ndash;assisted by the Person within the heart&amp;ndash;passed out of the body by way of one particular artery. Now of that road various accounts are given in Scripture. There is a detailed account in the Cḥāndogya. (IV, 15), &amp;rsquo;now whether people perform obsequies for him or not,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.</description>

      <description>(On the soul&amp;rsquo;s) having approached (the highest light) there is manifestation; (as we infer) from the word &amp;lsquo;own.&amp;rsquo; The Sūras now proceed to consider the kind of superior existence (aiśvarya) which the released souls enjoy.&amp;ndash;The text says, &amp;lsquo;Thus does that serene being, having risen from the body and having approached the highest light, manifest itself in its own form&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 12, 3). Does this passage mean that the soul having approached the highest light assumes a new body, to be brought about then, as e.</description>

      <description>And on account of its being declared that to which the released have to resort. The Person who is the abode of heaven, earth, and so
on, is also declared by the text to be what is to be reached by those who are released from the bondage of Saṁsāra existence. &amp;lsquo;When the seer sees the brilliant maker and Lord as the Person who has his source in Brahman, then possessing true knowledge he shakes off good and evil, and, free from passion, reaches the highest oneness&amp;rsquo; (Mu.</description>

      <description>But the subtle (body), on account of its capability. The elements in their fine state are what is called the &amp;lsquo;Unevolved,&amp;rsquo; and this entering into a particular condition becomes the body. It is the &amp;lsquo;Unevolved&amp;rsquo; in the particular condition of the body, which in the text under discussion is called the &amp;lsquo;Unevolved.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;On account of its capability,&amp;rsquo; i.e. because Unevolved non-sentient matter, when assuming certain states and forms, is capable of entering on activities promoting the interest of man.</description>

The &amp;lsquo;and&amp;rsquo; in the Sūtra has the force of &amp;lsquo;but,&amp;rsquo; being meant to dispel the doubt raised. There are many other authors of Smr̥tis, such as Manu, who through the power of their meditation had attained insight into the highest truth, and of whom it is known from Scripture that the purport of their teaching was a salutary medicine to the whole world (&amp;lsquo;whatever Manu said that was medicine&amp;rsquo;).</description>

      <description>If it be said&amp;ndash;like milk or water; there also (intelligence guides). What has been said&amp;ndash;the Sānkhya rejoins&amp;ndash;as to the impossibility of the Pradhāna not guided by an intelligent principle constructing this variously constituted world, is unfounded; for the Pradhāna may be supposed to act in the same way as milk and water do. Milk, when turning into sour milk, is capable of going by itself through a series of changes: it does not therefore depend on anything else.</description>

      <description>But there is. But there is origination of Ether. For Scripture, which is concerned with matters transcending sense perception, is able to establish the truth even of the origination of Ether, although this be not proved by other means of knowledge.
And in a matter known from Scripture a contradictory inference, such as that Ether cannot originate because it is without parts, is not of sufficient force. That the non-originatedness of the Self also does not rest on its being without parts will be shown further on.</description>

      <description>(The scriptural statement of the plural) is secondary, on account of impossibility; and since (the highest Self) is declared before that. The plural form exhibited by the text must be taken (not in its literal, but) in a secondary figurative sense, since there is no room there for a plurality of things. For Scripture
declares that previous to creation the highest Self only exists.</description>

      <description>But on account of (water) consisting of the three elements; on account of predominance. Water alone could not produce a new body; for the text Cḥ. Up. VI, 3, 4, &amp;lsquo;Each of these he made tripartite,&amp;rsquo; shows that all the elements were&amp;rsquo; made tripartite to the end of producing bodies. That the text under discussion mentions water only, is due to the predominance of water; and that among the elements giving rise to a new body water predominates, we infer from the fact that blood and the other humours are the predominating element in the body.</description>

      <description>And some (state the soul to be) the shaper; and sons, and so on. And the followers of one śākhā state in their text that the dreaming soul is the shaper of its desires: &amp;lsquo;He, the person who is awake in those who sleep, shaping one desired thing (kāma) after the other.&amp;rsquo; The term &amp;lsquo;kāma&amp;rsquo; there denotes not mere desires, but such things as sons and the like which are objects of desire.</description>

      <description>If it be said (that the vidyās are not one) on account of difference, we deny this, since even in one (vidyā there may be repetition). If it be said that there is no oneness of vidyā, because the fact of the same matter being stated again without difference, and being met with in a different chapter, proves the object of injunction to be different; we reply that even in one and the same vidyā some matter may be repeated without any change, and under a new heading (in a different chapter); if, namely, there is difference of cognising subjects.</description>

      <description>On account of (the Self) standing in a complementary relation, they are arthavādas, as in other cases; thus Jaimini opines. What has been said as to Scripture intimating that a beneficial result is realised through the meditations by themselves is untenable. For texts such as &amp;lsquo;he who knows Brahman reaches the Highest&amp;rsquo; do not teach that the highest aim of man is attained through knowledge; their purport rather is to inculcate knowledge of Truth on the part of a Self which is the agent in works prescribed.</description>

      <description>And on account of an inferential mark. Inferential mark here means Smr̥ti. Smr̥ti also declares that that knowledge which effects Release is of the nature of continued representation.

Because speech&amp;rsquo;s becoming one with mind means only conjunction with the latter, not merging within it; there is also no objection to what Scripture says as to all other organs that follow speech being united with mind.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;speech.&amp;rsquo;</description>

      <description>The released one; on account of the promise. What the text says about the soul accomplishing itself in its own form refers to the released soul which, freed from its connexion with works and what depends thereon, i.e. the body and the rest, abides in its true essential nature.&amp;ndash;That essential nature no doubt is something eternally accomplished, but as in the Saṁsāra state it is obscured by Nescience in the form of Karman; the text refers to the</description>

      <description>Not that which is inferred, on account of the absence of terms denoting it, and (so also not) the bearer of the Prāṇas (i. e. the individual soul). As the section under discussion does not treat of the Pradhāna, there being no terms referring to that, so it is with regard to the individual soul also.

      <description>And because from the independence (of the Pradhāna) there would follow the non-existence of what is different (from creation, i.e. of the pralaya condition). That the Pradhāna which is not guided by an intelligent principle is not the universal cause is proved also by the fact that, if we ascribe to it a power for change independent of the guidance of a Lord capable of realising all his purposes, it would follow that the pralaya state, which is different from the state of creation, would not exist; while on the other hand the guidance of the Pradhāna by a Lord explains the alternating states of creation and pralaya as the effects of his purposes.</description>

      <description>It has a secondary sense, on account of impossibility and of the text. It is reasonable to assume that in passages such as &amp;lsquo;From that Self there sprang Ether.&amp;rsquo; the origination of Ether is not to be taken in its literal sense; for according to the Cḥāndogya-text &amp;lsquo;it sent forth fire.&amp;rsquo; Brahman engaged in creation first produces fire, and fire thus having the first place, the text cannot possibly mean to say that Ether also was produced.</description>

      <description>On account of speech having for its antecedent that. For the following reason also the word &amp;lsquo;prāṇa,&amp;rsquo; in the text quoted, can denote Brahman only. Speech, i.e. the names which have for their object all things apart from Brahman, presupposes the existence of the entire universe of things&amp;ndash;ether, and so on&amp;ndash;which is the object of speech.

      <description>And on account of the going of the prāṇas. That the soul goes embedded in the subtle rudiments of the elements follows therefrom also that when passing out of the old body it is said to be followed by the prāṇas, &amp;lsquo;when he thus passes out, the chief prāṇa follows after him,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.

      <description>For (the śirovrata) concerns the mode of the study of the Veda; also on account of (that rite) being a heading in the samācāra; and the restriction is like that of the libations. What the text says as to a restriction connected with the &amp;lsquo;vow of the head,&amp;rsquo; does not intimate a difference of vidyās. For that vow does not form part of the vidyā. The restriction refers only to a peculiarity of the study of the Veda on the part of the Ātharvaṇikas, being meant to establish that they should possess that special qualification which the rite produces; but it does not affect the vidyā itself.</description>

      <description>On account of (such) conduct being seen. It is seen, viz in Scripture, that those who knew Brahman busied themselves chiefly with sacrifices.&amp;ndash;Aśvapati Kaikeya had a deep knowledge of the Self; but when three R̥shis had come to him to receive instruction regarding the Self, he told them &amp;lsquo;I am about, to perform a sacrifice, Sirs&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. V, II). Similarly we learn from Smr̥ti that Janaka and other princes deeply versed in the knowledge of Brahman applied themselves to sacrificial works, &amp;lsquo;By works only Janaka and others attained to perfection&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;He also, well founded in knowledge, offered many sacrifices.</description>

      <description>But as the Self; this (the ancient Devotees) acknowledge (since the texts) make (them) apprehend (in that way). The following point is now taken into consideration. Is Brahman to be meditated upon as something different from the meditating Devotee, or as the Self of the latter?&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin holds the former view. For, he says, the individual soul is something different from Brahman; as has been proved under II, 1, 22; III, 4, 8; I, 1, 15.</description>

      <description>Beyond lightning there is Varuṇa, on account of connexion. According to the text of the Kaushītakins the soul goes on to the world of Vāyu, to the world of Varuṇa, to the world of Indra, to the world of Prajāpati, to the world of Brahman. The doubt here arises whether Varuṇa and the divinities of the following stages are to be inserted in the series after Vāyu, in agreement with the order of enumeration in the text of the Kaushītakins; or at the end of the whole series as stated in the Cḥāndogya.</description>

The subject-matter of the whole section shows that by the Self manifesting itself in its own form there is meant the Self as possessing the attributes of freedom from all evil and sin and so on.

by &amp;ldquo;anīśā&amp;rdquo;; but when he sees the other one, the Lord, contented, and his glory; then his grief passes away&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. III, 1, 2).

      <description>And on account of there being no statement of its being an object of knowledge. If the text meant the Non-evolved as understood by the Sānkhyas it would refer to it as something to be known; for the Sānkhyas, who hold the theory of Release resulting from the discriminative knowledge of the Evolved, the
Non-evolved, and the soul, admit that all these are objects of knowledge. Now our text does not refer to the Un-evolved as an object of knowledge, and it cannot therefore be the Pradhāna assumed by the Sānkhyas.</description>

      <description>Not, on account of the difference of character of that; and its being such (appears) from Scripture. The same opponent who laid stress on the conflict between Scripture and Smr̥ti now again comes forward, relying this time (not on Smr̥ti but) on simple reasoning. Your doctrine, he says, as to the world being an effect of Brahman which you attempted to prove by a refutation of the Sānkhya Smr̥ti shows itself to be irrational for the following reason.</description>

      <description>Nor like grass and so on; because (milk) does not exist elsewhere. This argumentation does not hold good; for as grass and the like do not transform themselves without the guidance of an intelligent principle, your proving instance is not established.&amp;ndash;But why is it not established?&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Because it does not exist elsewhere.&amp;rsquo; If grass, water and so on changed into milk even when consumed by a bull or when not consumed at all, then indeed it might be held that they change without the guidance of an intelligent principle.</description>

      <description>There may be (a double sense) of the one (word), as in the case of the word &amp;lsquo;Brahman.&amp;rsquo; Since in the clause &amp;lsquo;from that Self there sprang Brahman,&amp;rsquo; the word &amp;lsquo;sprang&amp;rsquo; cannot be taken in its literal senbe, it may be used there in a secondary sense; while the same word as connected with the subsequent clauses &amp;lsquo;from Vāyu Agni,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., may have its primary sense. This would be analogous to the use of the word Brahman in Mu.</description>

      <description>If it be said (that it is not so) on account of scriptural statement as to going to Agni and the rest; we say no, on account of the secondary nature (of the statement). But the text, &amp;lsquo;when the speech of the dead person enters into fire,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Br̥. Up. III, 2, 13). declares that when a person dies his organs go into fire, and so on.; they cannot therefore accompany the soul.</description>

      <description>But owing to the wish of the highest it is hidden; for from that are its bondage and the opposite state. The but sets the objection aside. Owing to the wish of the highest, i.e. the Supreme Person, the essential nature of the individual soul is hidden. The Supreme Person hides the true, essentially blessed, nature of the soul which is in a state of sin owing to the endless chain of karman.</description>

      <description>Scripture also declares this. Scripture also shows that (identical) meditation is what all the Vedānta-texts intimate. The Cḥāndogya (VIII, 1, 1 ff.) declares that that which is within the small space in the heart is to be enquired into, and then in reply to the
question what the thing to be enquired into is, says that it is the highest Self possessing the eight attributes, freedom from all evil and the rest, which is to be meditated upon within the heart.</description>

      <description>On account of direct scriptural statement. Scripture itself directly declares knowledge to be subordinate to works, &amp;lsquo;whatever he does with knowledge, with faith, with the Upanishad, that is more vigorous&amp;rsquo;. Nor can it be said that this text refers, on the ground of leading subject-matter (prakaraṇa), to the Udgītha only; for direct scriptural statement (śuti) is stronger than subject-matter,
and the words &amp;lsquo;whatever he does with knowledge&amp;rsquo; clearly refer to knowledge in general.</description>

III, 18, 1); &amp;lsquo;He who meditates on name as Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up.

      <description>That (is united) with the ruler, on account of the going to it, and so on. As from the statements that speech becomes united with mind and mind with breath it follows that speech and
mind are united with mind and breath only; so we conclude from the subsequent clause &amp;lsquo;breath with fire&amp;rsquo; that breath becomes united with fire only.&amp;ndash;Against this primā facie view the Sūtra declares &amp;rsquo;that breath becomes united with the ruler of the organs, i.</description>

      <description>Conductors, this being indicated. The decision here is that light, Vāyu, and the rest mentioned in the texts as connected with the soul&amp;rsquo;s progress on the path of the Gods are to be interpreted not as mere marks indicating the road, nor as places of enjoyment for the soul, but as divinities appointed by the Supreme Person to conduct the soul along the stages of the road; for this is indicated by what the Cḥandogya.</description>

      <description>In non-division; because that is seen. Is the soul, when it has reached the highest light and freed itself from all bondage, conscious of itself as separate from the highest Self or as non-separate in so far as being a mere &amp;lsquo;mode&amp;rsquo; (prakāra) of that Self?&amp;ndash;The former view is the right one. For Scriptural and Smr̥ti texts alike declare that the released soul stands to the highest Self in the relation of fellowship, equality, equality of attributes, and all this implies consciousness of separation.</description>

      <description>On account of the subject-matter. It has been already shown, viz. under I, 2, 21, that the highest Brahman constitutes the initial topic of the Upanishad. And by the arguments set forth in the previous Sūtras of the present Pāda, we have removed all suspicion as to the topic started being dropped in the body of the Upanishad.</description>

      <description>And if you say&amp;ndash;as the man and the stone; thus also. Here the following view might be urged. Although the soul consists of mere intelligence and is inactive, while the Pradhāna is destitute of all power of thought; yet the non-sentient Pradhāna may begin to act owing to the mere nearness of the soul. For we observe parallel instances. A man blind but capable of motion may act in some way, owing to the nearness to him of some lame man who has no power of motion but possesses good eyesight and assists the blind man with his intelligence.</description>

      <description>The non-abandonment of the promissory statement (results) from non-difference. It is not appropriate to assume, from deference to the Cḥāndogya-text, a secondary meaning for those other texts also which declare Ether to have originated. For the Cḥāndogyaitself virtually admits the origination of Ether; in so far, namely, as the clause &amp;rsquo;that by which the non-heard is heard,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., declares that through the knowledge of Brahman everything is known. This declaration is not abandoned, i.</description>

      <description>But the hands and so on also; (since they assist the soul) abiding (in the body). Hence (it is) not so. The organs are not seven only, but eleven, since the hands and the rest also contribute towards the experience and fruition of that which abides in the body, i.e. the soul, and have their separate offices, such as seizing, and so on.

      <description>Or that (results) also from connexion with the body. The obscuration of the soul&amp;rsquo;s true nature results either from the soul&amp;rsquo;s connexion with the body or from its connexion with the power of matter in a subtle state. As long as the creation lasts, the soul is obscured by its connexion with matter in the form of a body; at the time of a pralaya, on the other hand, by its connexion with matter of so exceedingly subtle a kind as not to admit of differentiation by means of name and form.</description>

      <description>The view of Brahman, on account of superiority. The view of Brahman may appropriately be superimposed on mind and the like; but not the view of mind, and so on, on Brahman. For Brahman is something superior to mind, and so on; while the latter are inferior to Brahman. To view a superior person, a prince e.g., as a servant would be lowering; while, on the other hand, to view a servant as a prince is exalting.</description>

      <description>From thence by him only who belongs to lightning, the text stating that. The only leader from lightning up to Brahman is the not-human person connected with lightning; for the text states this directly. Varuṇa, Indra, and Prajāpati take part in the work in so far only as they may assist the person connected with lightning.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;the conductors.&#39;</description>

      <description>In (a nature like) that of Brahman, thus Jaimini thinks; on account of suggestion and the rest. Owing to the fact that different texts give different accounts, the question now arises of what character that essential nature of the Self is in which it manifests itself on reaching Brahman. Is that nature constituted by freedom from evil and sin and the rest (i.e. the attributes enumerated Cḥ. Up. VIII, 7, 1); or by mere intelligence (vijñāna); or by both, there being no opposition between intelligence and those other attributes?</description>

      <description>And on account of abiding and eating. &amp;lsquo;Two birds, inseparable friends, cling to the same tree. One of them eats the sweet fruit; without eating, the other looks on&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1). This text declares that one enjoys the fruit of works while the other, without enjoying, shining abides within the body. Now this shining being which does not enjoy the fruit of works can only be the being previously described as the abode of heaven, earth, &amp;amp;c.</description>

      <description>And of three only there is this mention and question. In the Upanishad under discussion there is mention
made of three things only as objects of knowledge&amp;ndash;the three standing to one another in the relation of means, end to be realised by those means, and persons realising,&amp;ndash;and questions are asked as to those three only. There is no mention of, nor question referring to, the Unevolved.&amp;ndash;Naciketas desirous of Release having been allowed by Death to choose three boons, chooses for his first boon that his father should be well disposed towards him&amp;ndash;without which he could not hope for spiritual welfare.</description>

      <description>And on account of the impossibility of the relation of principal (and subordinate) matter. You Sānkhyas maintain that the origination of the world results from a certain relation between principal and subordinate entities which depends on the relative inferiority
and superiority of the guṇas&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;according to the difference of the abodes of the several guṇas&amp;rsquo; (Sānkhya Kā. I, 16).
But, as in the pralaya state the three guṇas are in a state of equipoise, none of them being superior or inferior to the others, that relation of superiority and subordination cannot then exist, and hence the world cannot originate.</description>

      <description>And (they are) minute. As the text &amp;rsquo;these are all alike, all infinite&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. I, 5, 13), declares speech, mind, and breath to be infinite, we conclude that the prāṇas are all-pervading.&amp;ndash;To this the Sūtra replies, that they are minute; for the text &amp;lsquo;when the vital breath passes out of the body, all the prāṇas pass out after it&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. V, 4, 2), proves those prāṇas to be of limited size, and as when passing out they are not perceived by bystanders, they must be of minute size&amp;ndash;The text which speaks of them as infinite is a text enjoining meditation (&amp;lsquo;he who meditates on them as infinite&amp;rsquo;), and infinity there means only that abundance of activities which is an attribute of the prāṇa to be meditated on.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;On account of this not being stated by Scripture&amp;rsquo;; not so, on account of those who perform sacrifices and so on being understood. But, a further objection is raised, in the whole section under discussion no mention at all is made of the soul; the section cannot therefore prove that the soul moves, enveloped by water. The text speaks only of different forms of water śraddhā and the rest.&amp;ndash;This, the Sūtra points out, is not so, on account of those who perform sacrifices being understood.</description>

      <description>And it is suggestive, according to Scripture; this the experts also declare. The things seen in dreams are not created by the wish of the individual soul for this reason also, that according to Scripture dreams are prophetic of future good or ill fortune. &amp;lsquo;When a man engaged in some work undertaken for some special wish sees a woman in his dream, he may infer success from his dream vision.</description>

      <description>If it be said that there is difference on account of the text; we say no; on account of non-difference. So far it has been shown that the non-difference of injunction,
and so on, establishes the unity of meditations, and that owing to the latter the special features of meditation enjoined in different texts have to be combined. Next, an enquiry is entered upon whether in the case of certain particular meditations there actually exists, or not, that non-difference of injunction which is the cause of meditations being recognised as identical.</description>

      <description>On account of injunction for such a one. That knowledge is subordinate to works follows therefrom also that works are enjoined on him only who possesses knowledge. For texts such as &amp;lsquo;He who has learnt the Veda from a family of teachers,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 15), enjoin works on him only who has mastered the sacred texts so as fully to understand their meaning&amp;ndash;for this is the sense of the term &amp;rsquo;learning&amp;rsquo; (adhyayana).</description>

Up. I, 3, 1).&amp;ndash;With regard to this and similar meditations connected with subordinate parts of sacrificial performances there arises the doubt whether

      <description>Not with one; for both declare this. Not with one; because each element by itself is incapable of producing an effect. Such incapability is declared by Scripture and tradition alike. The text &amp;lsquo;Having entered these beings with this jīva soul let me reveal names and forms&amp;ndash;let me make each of these three tripartite&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up.
VI, 3) teaches that the elements were rendered tripartite in order to be capable of evolving names and forms; and of similar import is the following Smr̥ti text, &amp;lsquo;Possessing various powers these (elements), being separate from one another, were unable to produce creatures without combining.</description>

      <description>In the sole nature of intelligence; as that is its Self. Thus Auḍulomi thinks. Intelligence (consciousness; caitanya) alone is the true nature of the soul, and hence it is in that character only that the released soul manifests itself; this is the view of the teacher Auḍulomi. That intelligence only constitutes the true being of the soul, we learn from the express statement &amp;lsquo;As a lump of salt has neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a mass of taste; so this Self has neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a mass of knowledge&amp;rsquo; (Br̥.</description>

      <description>The bhūman (is the highest Self), as the instruction about it is additional to that about serenity. The Cḥandogas read as follows: &amp;lsquo;Where one sees nothing
else, hears nothing else, knows nothing else, that is fulness (bhūman). Where one sees something else, hears something else, knows something else, that is the Little&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VII, 23, 24).
The term &amp;lsquo;bhūman&amp;rsquo; is derived from bahu (much, many), and primarily signifies &amp;lsquo;muchness.</description>

      <description>If it be said that (the effect is) non-existing; we say no, there being a mere denial. But, an objection is raised, if Brahman, the cause, differs in nature from the effect, viz. the world, this means that cause and effect are separate things and that hence the effect does not exist in the cause, i.e. Brahman; and this again implies that the world originates from what has no existence!</description>

      <description>And if another inference be made (the result remains unchanged), on account of (the Pradhāna) being destitute of the power of a knowing subject. Even if the Pradhāna were inferred by some reasoning different from the arguments so far refuted by us, our objections would remain in force because, anyhow, the Pradhāna is devoid of the power of a cognising subject. The Pradhāna thus cannot be established by any mode of inference.</description>

By &amp;rsquo;the best&amp;rsquo; we have to understand the chief vital air (mukhya prāṇa), which, in the colloquy of the prāṇas, is determined to be the best because it is the cause of the preservation of the body.

      <description>Or it is metaphorical, on account of their not knowing the Self. For thus Scripture declares. He who performs sacrifices, and so on, and thus does not know the Self, is here below and in yonder world a mere
means of enjoyment for the devas. He serves them here, by propitiating them with sacrifices, and so on; and when the gods, pleased with his service, have taken him up into yonder world, he there is a common means of enjoyment for them (since they are gratified by the presence of a faithful servant).</description>

      <description>The absence of that takes place in the nāḍīs and in the Self, according to scriptural statement. Next the state of deep dreamless sleep is enquired into. Scripture says, &amp;lsquo;When a man is asleep, reposing and at perfect rest, so that he sees no dream, then he lies asleep in those nāḍīs&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 6, 3); &amp;lsquo;When he is in profound sleep and is conscious of nothing, there are seventy-two thousand veins called hita which from the heart spread through the pericardium.</description>

      <description>Or not, on account of difference of subject-matter; as in the case of the attribute of being higher than the high, and so on. There is no unity of the two vidyās, since the subject-matter of the two differs. For the tale in the Cḥāndogya-text, which begins &amp;lsquo;when the Devas and the Asuras struggled together,&amp;rsquo; connects itself with the praṇava (the syllable Om) which is introduced as the object of meditation in Cḥánd.</description>

      <description>On account of definite rule. Another argument for our conclusion is that the text &amp;lsquo;Doing works here let a man desire to live a hundred years,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Is. Up. II), expressly enjoins lifelong works on him who knows the Self. The general conclusion, therefore, is that knowledge (meditation) is merely auxiliary to works. Of this view the next Sūtra finally disposes.</description>

      <description>Sitting; on account of possibility. It has been shown that that special form of cognitional activity which the Vedānta-texts set forth as the means of accomplishing final Release and which is called meditation (dhyāna; upāsana) has to be frequently repeated, and is of the nature of continued representation. A question now arises as to the way in which it has to be carried on.&amp;ndash;There being no special restrictive rule, the Pūrvapakshin holds that the Devotee may carry it on either sitting or lying down or standing or walking.</description>

      <description>And it is common up to the beginning of the way; and the immortality (is that which is obtained), without having burned. Is this departure of the soul common to him who knows and him who does not know?&amp;ndash;It belongs to him only who does not know, the Pūrvapakshin holds. For Scripture declares that for him who knows there is no departure, and that hence he becomes immortal then and there (irrespective of any departure of the soul to another place), &amp;lsquo;when all desires which once dwelt in his heart are undone, then the mortal becomes immortal, then he obtains Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Br̥.</description>

      <description>And on account of (Brahman) being specified. The text &amp;lsquo;a person not human leads them to the worlds of Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. VI. 2, 15) by using the word &amp;lsquo;world,&amp;rsquo; and moreover in the plural, determines the specification that the not-human person leads those only who meditate on Hiraṇyagarbha, who dwells within some particular world.
Moreover, the text &amp;lsquo;I enter the hall of Prajāpati, the house&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up.VIII, 14) shows that he who goes on the path beginning with light aims at approaching Hiraṇyagarbha.</description>

      <description>Thus also, on account of existence of the former qualities (as proved) by suggestion, Bādarayaṇa holds absence of contradiction. The teacher Bādarāyaṇa is of opinion that even thus, i.e. although the text declares the soul to have mere intelligence for its essential nature, all the same the previously stated attributes, viz. freedom from all sin, and so on, are not to be excluded. For the authority of a definite statement in the Upanishads proves them to exist (&amp;lsquo;That Self which is free fiom sin,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.</description>

      <description>And on account of the suitability of the attributes. The attributes also which the text ascribes to the bhūman suit the highest Self only. So immortality (&amp;lsquo;The Bhūman is immortal,&amp;rsquo; VII, 24, 1); not being based on something else (&amp;lsquo;it rests in its own greatness&amp;rsquo;); being the Self of all (&amp;rsquo;the bhūman is below,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., &amp;lsquo;it is all this&amp;rsquo;); being that which produces all (&amp;lsquo;from the Self there springs breath,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.</description>

      <description>On account of there being no special characteristic; as in the case of the cup. In the discussion of the following passages also we aim only at refuting the system of the Sankhyas; not at disproving the existence and nature of Prakr̥ti, the &amp;lsquo;great&amp;rsquo; principle, the ahaṁāra, and so on, viewed as dependent on Brahman. For that they exist in this latter relation is proved by Scripture as well as Smr̥ti.</description>

      <description>On account of such consequences in reabsorption (the Vedānta-texts would be) inappropriate. The term &amp;lsquo;reabsorption&amp;rsquo; here stands as an instance of all the states of Brahman, reabsorption, creation, and so on&amp;ndash;among which it is the first as appears from the texts giving instruction about those several states &amp;lsquo;Being only was this in the beginning&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;The Self only was this in the beginning.&amp;rsquo; If we accept the doctrine of the oneness of substance of cause and effect, then, absorption, creation, &amp;amp;c.</description>

      <description>And even if it be admitted; on account of the absence of a purpose. Even if it were admitted that the Pradhāna is established by Inference, the Sānkhya theory could not be accepted for the reason that the Pradhāna is without a purpose. For, according to the view expressed in the passage, &amp;lsquo;In order that the soul may know the Pradhāna and become isolated&amp;rsquo; (Sānkhya Kā. I, 21), the purpose of the Pradhāna is fruition and final release on the part of the soul; but both these are impossible.</description>

      <description>Hereby air is explained. The same argumentation explains the origination of air also. That a special Sūtra is devoted to the origination of air&amp;ndash;instead of disposing in one Sūtra of Ether and air&amp;ndash;is for the sake of Sūtra 10, which states that &amp;lsquo;hence (i.e. from air) there originated fire.&amp;rsquo;</description>

      <description>Neither air nor function, on account of its being stated separately. Is this main vital breath nothing else but air, the second of the elements? Or is it a certain motion of the air? Or is it air that has assumed some special condition?&amp;ndash;The first alternative may be adopted, on account of the text &amp;lsquo;prāṇa is air.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;Or, since mere air is not called breath, while this term is generally applied to that motion of air which consists in inhalation and exhalation, we may hold that breath is a motion of air.</description>

      <description>On the passing away of the works, with a remainder, according to Scripture and Smr̥ti; as it went and not so.

      <description>Hence the awaking from that. Since Brahman alone directly is the place of deep sleep, Scripture is able to declare that the souls awake from that, i.e. Brahman; compare &amp;lsquo;Having come back from the True they do not know that they come from the True&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ.

      <description>If that be declared on account of name; (we object, since) that is also (where the objects of injunction differ). If the oneness of the vidyās be maintained on the ground that both have the same name, viz. udgītha-vidyā, we point out that oneness is found also where the objects enjoined are different. The term agnihotra is applied equally to the permanent agnihotra and to that agnihotra which forms part of the sacrifice called &amp;lsquo;Kuṇḍapāyinām ayanam&amp;rsquo;; and the term udgītha is applied equally to the many different meditations described in the first prapāṭḥaka of the Cḥāndogya.</description>

      <description>But on account of the teaching of the different one, Badarāyaṇa&amp;rsquo;s (view is valid); as this is seen. Knowledge by itself benefits man; since Scripture teaches that the object of knowledge is the highest Brahman which, as it is of an absolutely faultless and perfect nature, is other than the active individual soul.
Badarāyaṇa, therefore, holds that knowledge has an independent fruit of its own. Let the inferential marks (referred to by the Pūrvapakshin) be; the direct teaching of the texts certainly refers to a being different from the</description>

      <description>And on account of meditation. Since, as intimated by the text,&amp;rsquo;the Self is to be meditated
upon,&amp;rsquo; the mental activity in question is of the nature of meditation, it requires as its necessary condition concentration of mind. For by meditation is understood thought directed upon one object and not disturbed by the ideas of other things.</description>

      <description>Since, up to the union with that (i.e. Brahman) the texts describe the Saṁsāra state. The immortality referred to must necessarily be understood as not implying dissolution of the soul&amp;rsquo;s connexion with the body, since up to the soul&amp;rsquo;s attaining to Brahman the texts describe the Saṁsāra state. That attaining to Brahman takes place, as will be shown further on, after the soul&amp;ndash;moving on the path the first stage of which is light&amp;ndash;has reached a certain place.</description>

      <description>But on account of nearness there is that designation. Hiraṇyagarbha is the first created being (as declared by the text &amp;lsquo;he who creates Brahma&amp;rsquo;); he thus stands near to Brahman, and therefore may be designated by the same term (viz. Brahman). This explanation is necessitated by the reasons set forth in the preceding Sūtras (which show that the real highest Brahman cannot be meant).&amp;ndash;But, if the soul advancing on the path of the Gods reaches Hiraṇyagarbha only, texts such as &amp;lsquo;This is the path of the Gods, the path of Brahman; those who proceed on that path do not return to the life of man&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ.</description>

      <description>By the mere will; Scripture stating that. Concerning the released soul Scripture states, &amp;lsquo;He moves about there, laughing, playing, rejoicing, be it with women, or chariots, or relatives&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 12, 3). The doubt here arises whether the soul&amp;rsquo;s meeting with relatives and the rest presupposes an effort on its part or follows on its mere will&amp;ndash;as things spring from the mere will of the highest Person.&amp;ndash;An effort is required; for we observe in ordinary life that even such persons as kings and the like who are capable of realising all their wishes do not accomplish the effects desired without some effort.</description>

      <description>The Imperishable (is Brahman), on account of its supporting that which is the end of ether. The Vājasaneyins, in the chapter recording the questions asked by Gārgī, read as follows: &amp;lsquo;He said, O Gārgī, the Brāhmaṇas call that the Imperishable. It is neither coarse nor fine, neither short nor long, it is not red, not fluid, it is without a shadow,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Br̥. Up. III, 8, 8). A doubt here arises whether that Imperishable be the Pradhāna, or the individual soul, or the highest Self.</description>

      <description>But she begins with light; for thus some read in their text. The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; has assertory force. &amp;lsquo;Light&amp;rsquo; in the Sūtra means Brahman, in accordance with the meaning of the term as known from texts such as &amp;lsquo;On him the gods meditate, the light of lights&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. X, 4, 16); &amp;lsquo;That light which shines beyond heaven&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up.

      <description>Not so; as there are parallel instances. The teaching of the Vedānta-texts is not inappropriate, since there are instances of good and bad qualities being separate in the case of one thing connected with two
different states. The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; in the Sūtra indicates the impossibility of Brahman being connected with even a shadow of what is evil. The meaning is as follows. As Brahman has all sentient and non-sentient things for its body, and constitutes the Self of that body, there is nothing contrary to reason in Brahman being connected with two states, a causal and an effected one, the essential characteristics of which are expansion on the one hand and contraction on the other; for this expansion and contraction belong (not to Brahman itself, but) to the sentient and non-sentient beings.</description>

      <description>And (it is) objectionable on account of the contradictions. The Sānkhya-system, moreover, labours from many internal contradictions.&amp;ndash;The Sānkhyas hold that while Prakr̥ti is for the sake of another and the object of knowledge and fruition, the soul is independent, an enjoying and knowing agent, and conscious of Prakr̥ti; that the soul reaches isolation through the instrumentality of Prakr̥ti only, and that as its nature is pure, permanent, unchanging consciousness, absence of all activity and isolation belong to that nature; that for this reason the accomplishing of the means of bondage and release and of release belong to Prakr̥ti only; and that, owing to Prakr̥ti&amp;rsquo;s proximity to the unchanging non-active soul, Prakr̥ti, by a process of mutual superimposition (adhyāsa), works towards the creation of a world and subserves the purposes of the soul&amp;rsquo;s fruition and emancipation.</description>

      <description>But there is non-origination of that which is (only); on account of impossibility. The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; has an affirmative sense. There is non-origination of that which is, i.e. of Brahman only; of whatever is different from Brahman non-origination cannot possibly be established. This means&amp;ndash;the origination of Ether and air has been proved only in order to illustrate a general truth. Only that which iś, i.e. Brahman, which is the general cause, cannot originate.</description>

      <description>But like the eye and the rest, on account of being taught with them, and for other reasons. Breath is not an element, but like sight and the rest, a special instrument of the soul. This appears from the fact that the texts mention it together with the recognised organs of the soul, the eye, and so on; so e.g. in the colloquy of the prāṇas. And such common mention is suitable in the case of such things only as belong to one class.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;On account of conduct&amp;rsquo;; not so, since (caraṇa) connotes works; thus Kārshṇājini thinks. In the phrases &amp;rsquo;those whose works were good&amp;rsquo; (ramaṇīya-caraṇāḥ), and &amp;rsquo;those whose works were bad&amp;rsquo; (kapūyā-caraṇāḥ), the word caraṇa does not denote good and evil works (i.e. not such works as the Veda on the one hand enjoins as leading to certain rewards, and on the other prohibits, threatening punishment), for, in Vedic as well as ordinary language, the term caraṇa is generally used in the sense of ācāra, i.</description>

      <description>But the same, on account of work, remembrance, text, and injunction. Does the same person who had gone to sleep rise again at the time of waking, or a different one?&amp;ndash;Since the soul in deep sleep frees itself from all limiting adjuncts, unites itself with Brahman, and thus being in no way different from the released soul, is no longer in any way connected with its previous body, organs, and so on; the person rising from sleep is a different one.</description>

      <description>And (this is) appropriate, on account of the extension. Since the praṇava, which is a part of the udgītha, is introduced as the subject of meditation in the first prapāṭḥaka of the Cḥāndogya, and extends over the later vidyās also, it is appropriate to assume that also in the clause &amp;rsquo;the gods took the udgītha&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;which stands in the middle&amp;ndash;the term udgītha denotes the praṇava.

      <description>But the declarations are equal. The argument that knowledge must be held subordinate to work because we learn from Scripture that those who know Brahman perform sacrificial works, will not hold good; since, on the other hand, we also see that men knowing Brahman abandoned all work; cp. texts such as &amp;lsquo;The R̥shis descended from Kavasha said: For what purpose should we study the Veda? for what purpose should we sacrifice?</description>

      <description>And the subtle (body persists), on account of a means of knowledge, it being thus observed (in Scripture).
The bondage of him who knows is not, at that stage, dissolved, for this reason also that the subtle body continues to persist.&amp;ndash;How is this known?&amp;ndash;Through a means of knowledge, viz. because it is thus seen in Scripture.

      <description>And for this very reason without another ruler. Since the released soul realises all its wishes, it does not stand under another ruler. For to be under a ruler means to be subject to injunction and prohibition, and to be such is opposed to being free in the realisation of all one&amp;rsquo;s wishes. Hence Scripture says, &amp;lsquo;he is a Self-ruler&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VII, 25).&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;wishes.&amp;rsquo;</description>

      <description>And on account of the teaching of formation (i.e. creation) there is no contradiction; as in the case of the honey. The &amp;lsquo;and&amp;rsquo; expresses disposal of a doubt that had arisen. There is no contradiction between the Prakr̥ti being ajā and originating from light. On account of instruction being given about the formation (kalpana), i.e. creation of the world. This interpretation of &amp;lsquo;kalpana&amp;rsquo; is in agreement with the use of the verb klip in the text, &amp;lsquo;as formerly the creator made (akalpayat) sun and moon.</description>

      <description>And on account of the objections to his view. The theory of Brahman being the universal cause has to be accepted not only because it is itself free from objections, but also because the pradhāna theory is open to objections, and hence must be abandoned. For on this latter theory the origination of the world cannot be accounted for. The Sānkhyas hold that owing to the soul&amp;rsquo;s approximation to Prakr̥ti the attributes of the latter</description>

      <description>Fire (is produced) thence, for thus Scripture declares. It has been stated that everything different from Brahman is the effect of Brahman. The doubt now arises whether the more remote effects of Brahman originate, each of them, only from that substance which is their immediately antecedent cause or from Brahman in the form of that substance.&amp;ndash;The decision is that they originate from those
substances only; for the text &amp;lsquo;from air fire&amp;rsquo; directly states the origination of fire from air.</description>

      <description>And there is no objection on account of its not having an activity (karaṇa); for (Scripture) thus declares. The karaṇa of the Sūtra means kriyā, action. The objection raised on the ground that the principal breath does not exercise any form of activity helpful to the soul, is without force, since as a matter of fact Scripture declares that there is such an activity, in so far as the vital breath supports the body with all its organs.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;There is purposelessness&amp;rsquo;; not so, on account of the dependence on that. But if conduct has no result, it follows that good conduct,
as enjoined in the Smr̥tis, is useless!&amp;ndash;Not so, we reply; for holy works enjoined by the Veda depend on conduct, in so far as a man of good conduct only is entitled to perform those works. This appears from passages such as the following: &amp;lsquo;A man who is not pure is unfit for all religious work,&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Him who is devoid of good conduct the Vedas do not purify.</description>

      <description>In the swooning person there is half-combination; this being the remaining (hypothesis). With regard to a person lying in a swoon or stunned, the question arises whether that state of swoon is one of the other states, viz. deep sleep and so on, or whether it is a special condition of its own.&amp;ndash;The former alternative must be accepted. For the term &amp;lsquo;swoon&amp;rsquo; may be explained as denoting either deep sleep or some other acknowledged state, and there is no authority for assuming an altogether different new state.</description>

      <description>On account of non-difference of everything, those elsewhere. The Cḥāndogya and the Vajasaneyaka alike record a meditation on Praṇa; the object of meditation being Praṇa as possessing the qualities of being the oldest and the best, and also as possessing certain other qualities such as being the richest, and so on (Cḥ. Up. V, 1; Br̥. Up. VI, 1). In the text of the Kaushītakins, on the other hand, there is a meditation on Prāṇa which mentions the former qualities (&amp;lsquo;being the best&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;being the oldest&amp;rsquo;), but not the latter (&amp;lsquo;being the richest,&amp;rsquo; and so on).</description>

      <description>(It is) non-comprehensive. The scriptural declaration does not refer to all meditations, but only to the meditation on the Udgītha. In the clause &amp;lsquo;what he does with knowledge,&amp;rsquo; the &amp;lsquo;what&amp;rsquo; is in itself indefinite, and therefore must be defined as connecting itself with the Udgītha mentioned in the previous clause, &amp;lsquo;Let him meditate on the Udgītha.&amp;rsquo; The sentence cannot be construed to mean &amp;lsquo;whatever he does is to be done with knowledge,&amp;rsquo; but means &amp;rsquo;that which he does with knowledge becomes more vigorous,&amp;rsquo; and that which is done with knowledge that is the Udgītha.</description>

      <description>Hence not in the way of destruction of bondage. It thus appears that the text &amp;lsquo;when all desires which once entered his heart are undone, then does the mortal become immortal, then he obtains Brahman &amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 7), does not mean such immortality as would imply complete destruction of the state of bondage.</description>

      <description>And on account of Smr̥ti. This follows from Smr̥ti also, which declares &amp;lsquo;when the pralaya has come and the end of the Highest, they all together with Brahman enter the highest place.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;For all these reasons Bādari holds that the troop of the conducting deities, beginning with Light, leads the souls of those only who meditate on the effected Brahman, i e. Hiraṇyagarbha.</description>

      <description>The absence, Bādari holds; for thus Scripture says. A doubt arises whether the Released has a body and sense-organs, or not; or whether he has them or not just as he pleases. The teacher Bādari holds that body and sense-organs are absent; since the text declares this. The text&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;as long as he is embodied there is no freedom from pleasure and pain; but when he is free from the body then neither pleasure nor pain touches him&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ.</description>

      <description>And on account of the exclusion of (what is of) another nature (than Brahman). Another nature, i. e. the nature of the Pradhāna, and so on. A supplementary passage excludes difference on the part of the Imperishable from the supreme Person. &amp;lsquo;That Imperishable, O Gārgī, is unseen but seeing; unheard but hearing; unthought but thinking; unknown but knowing. There is nothing that sees but it, nothing that hears but it, nothing that thinks but it, nothing that knows but it.</description>

      <description>Not from the mention of the number even, on account of the diversity and of the excess. The Vājasaneyins read in their text &amp;lsquo;He in whom the five &amp;ldquo;five-people&amp;rdquo; and the ether rest, him alone I believe to be the Self; I, who know, believe him to be Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 17). The doubt here arises whether this text be meant to set forth the categories as established in Kapila&amp;rsquo;s doctrine, or not.</description>

      <description>Also in consequence of the ill-foundedness of reasoning. The theory, resting on Scripture, of Brahman being the universal cause must be accepted, and the theory of the Pradhāna must be abandoned, because all (mere) reasoning is ill-founded. This latter point is proved by the fact that the arguments set forth by Buddha, Kaṇāda, Akshapāda, Jina, Kapila and Patañjali respectively are all mutually contradictory.</description>

      <description>On both assumptions also there is no motion, and thence non-being (of the origination of the world). The atomic theory teaches that the world is produced by the successive formation of compounds, binary, ternary, and so on, due to the aggregation of atoms&amp;ndash;such aggregation resulting from the motion of the atoms. The primary motion of the atoms&amp;ndash;which are the cause of the origination of the entire world&amp;ndash;is assumed to be brought about by the unseen principle (adr̥shṭa), &amp;lsquo;The upward flickering of fire,the sideway motion of air, the primary motion on the part</description>

      <description>It is designated as having five functions like mind. As desire, and so on, are not principles different from mind, although they are different functions and produce different effects&amp;ndash;according to the text, &amp;lsquo;Desire, purpose, doubt, faith, want of faith, firmness, absence of firmness, shame, reflection, fear&amp;ndash;all this is mind&amp;rsquo; (Br̥.

      <description>But only good and evil works, thus Bādari thinks. As the verb ā-car takes karman for its object (puṇyaṁ karmā carati, &amp;amp;c.), and as the separate denotation (i.e. the use of apparently equivalent words, viz. ācar and karman) can be accounted for on the ground that one of them refers to works established by manifest texts, and the other to texts inferred from actually existing rules of good conduct; and as, when the primary meaning is possible, no secondary meaning must be adopted; nothing else but good and evil works (in the Vedic sense) are denoted by the word caraṇa: such is the opinion of the teacher Bādari.</description>

      <description>Not on account of place even (is there any imperfection) of the Highest; for everywhere (it is described) as having twofold characteristics. The different states of the individual soul have been discussed, to the end that an insight into their imperfections may give rise to indifference towards all worldly enjoyments. Next now, in order to give rise to the desire of attaining to Brahman, the Sūtras proceed to expound how Brahman&amp;rsquo;s nature is raised above all imperfections and constituted by mere blessed qualities.</description>

      <description>Bliss and other qualities, as belonging to the subject of the qualities. The point to be decided here is whether, or not, the essential qualities of Brahman are to be included in all meditations on the highest Brahman.&amp;ndash;Since there is no valid reason for including in a meditation those qualities which are not expressly mentioned in the section containing that meditation, only those qualities which are thus expressly mentioned should be included!</description>

      <description>There is distribution, as in the case of the hundred. As knowledge and work have different results, the text &amp;lsquo;of him knowledge and work lay hold&amp;rsquo; must be understood in a distributive sense, i.e. as meaning that knowledge lays hold of him to the end of bringing about its own particular result, and that so likewise does work. &amp;lsquo;As in the case of a hundred,&amp;rsquo; i.e. as it is understood that, when a man selling a field and a gem is said to receive two hundred gold pieces, one hundred are given for the field and one hundred for the gem.</description>

      <description>Where concentration of mind (is possible), there; on account of there being no difference. As the texts do not say anything as to special places and times, the only requisite of such places and times is that they should favour concentration of mind. This agrees with the declaration &amp;lsquo;Let a man apply himself to meditation in a level and clean place, &amp;amp;c., favourable to the mind&amp;rsquo; (Śvet. Up. II, 10).</description>

      <description>And to that very (subtle body) (there belongs) the warmth, this only being reasonable. It is observed that when a man is about to die there is some warmth left in some part or parts of the gross body. Now this warmth cannot really belong to the gross body, for it is not observed in other parts of that body (while yet there is no reason why it should be limited to some part); but it may reasonably be attributed to the subtle body which may abide in some part of the gross body (and into which the warmth of the entire gross body has withdrawn itself).</description>

      <description>The Highest, Jaimini thinks; on account of primariness of meaning. The teacher Jaimini is of opinion that those deities lead on the souls of those only who meditate on the highest Brahman. For in the text &amp;lsquo;a person not human leads them to Brahman&amp;rsquo; the word Brahman is naturally taken in its primary sense (i.e. the highest Brahman); the secondary sense (i.e. the effected Brahman) can be admitted only if there are other valid reasons to refer the passage to the effected Brahman.</description>

      <description>The presence, Jaimini holds; because the text declares manifoldness. The teacher Jaimini holds that the Released one has a body and senses; because the text declares manifoldness&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;He is onefold, he is threefold, he is fivefold, he is sevenfold&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VII, 26, 2). The Self which is one and indivisible cannot be manifold, and the various forms of manifoldness of which the text speaks therefore must depend on the body.</description>

      <description>On account of his being designated as the object of seeing, he (i.e. the highest Self) (is that object). The followers of the Atharva-veda, in the section containing the question asked by Satyakāma, read as follows: &amp;lsquo;He again who meditates with this syllable Aum of three Mātrās on the highest Person, he comes to light and to the sun.

      <description>And because owing to the acknowledgment of samavāya, there results a regressus in infinitum from equality. The Vaiśeshika doctrine is further untenable on account of the acknowledgment of samavāya.&amp;ndash;Why so?&amp;ndash;Because the samavāya also, like part, quality, and generic characteristics, requires something else to establish it, and that something else again requires some further thing to establish it&amp;ndash;from which there arises an infinite regress. To explain. The Vaiśeshikas assume the so-called samavāya relation, defining it as &amp;rsquo;that connexion which is the cause of the idea &amp;ldquo;this is here,&amp;rdquo; in the case of things permanently and inseparably connected, and standing to each other in the relation of abode and thing abiding in the abode.</description>

The question now arises whether those also who do not perform sacrifices go to the moon. The phrase &amp;lsquo;who do not perform sacrifices&amp;rsquo; denotes evil-doers
of two kinds, viz. those who do not do what is enjoined, and those who do what is forbidden.</description>

      <description>Should it be said &amp;lsquo;on account of difference&amp;rsquo;; not so, because with reference to each the text says what is not that. But, an objection is raised, we observe, that the individual soul also, although in reality possessing the same twofold attributes, viz. freedom from all evil and so on, as we learn from the teaching of Prajāpati (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 7), yet is affected with imperfections owing to the fact that it is</description>

      <description>Such qualities as having joy for its head, and so on, are not established, for if there were difference (of members) there would be increase and decrease. The declaration that the essential qualities of Brahman are established for all meditations, does not imply that such attributes as &amp;lsquo;having joy for its head&amp;rsquo; are equally established. For the latter are not qualities of Brahman, since they are mere elements in a figurative representation of Brahman under the form of an animal body.</description>

      <description>Of him who has merely read the Veda. Nor is there any force in the argument that knowledge is only auxiliary to work because works are enjoined on him who possesses knowledge. For the text which refers to the man &amp;lsquo;who has read the Veda&amp;rsquo; enjoins works on him who has merely read the texts, and reading there means nothing more than the apprehension of the aggregate of syllables called Veda, without any insight into their meaning.</description>

      <description>Up to death; for there also it is seen. The question now arises whether the meditation described which is the means of final Release is to be accomplished within one day, or to be continued day after day, until death.&amp;ndash;The view that it is accomplished within one day, as this will satisfy the scriptural injunction, is disposed of by the Sūtra. Meditation is to be continued until death. For Scripture declares that meditation has to take place &amp;rsquo;there,&amp;rsquo; i.</description>

      <description>If it be said that on account of the denial (it is not so); we deny this. From the embodied soul; for (that one is) clear, according to some. The contention that the soul of him who knows departs from the body in the same way as other souls do cannot be upheld, since Scripture expressly negatives such departure. For Br̥. Up. IV, 4, at first describes the mode of departure on the part of him who does not possess true knowledge (&amp;lsquo;He taking to himself those elements of light descends into the heart&amp;rsquo; up to &amp;lsquo;after him thus departing the Prāṇa departs&amp;rsquo;); then refers to his assuming another body (&amp;lsquo;he makes to himself another, newer and more beautiful shape&amp;rsquo;); then concludes the account of him who does not possess true knowledge (&amp;lsquo;having attained the end of these works whatever he does here, he again returns from that world to this world of action.</description>

      <description>And because Scripture declares it. And Scripture moreover directly declares that the soul which has departed by way of the artery in the upper part of the head and passed along the path of the Gods reaches the highest Brahman: &amp;lsquo;This serene being having risen from the body, having reached the highest light manifests itself in its own shape &amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 12, 3).&amp;ndash;Against the contention that the text &amp;lsquo;I enter the hall of Prajāpati, the house&amp;rsquo; shows that he who proceeds on the path beginning with light aims at the effected Brahman, the next Sūtra argues.</description>

      <description>By light, food not being (mentioned in the text) of some. In the text of some, viz. the Kāṇvas, where food is not mentioned, the five-people are recognised to be the five senses, owing to the phrase &amp;lsquo;of lights&amp;rsquo; which is met with in another complementary passage. In the mantra, &amp;lsquo;him the gods worship as the light of lights,&amp;rsquo; which precedes the mantra about the &amp;lsquo;five-people,&amp;rsquo; Brahman is spoken of as the light of lights, and this suggests the idea of certain lights the activity of which depends on Brahman.</description>

      <description>Thereby also the remaining (theories) which are not comprised (within the Veda) are explained. Not comprised means those theories which are not known to be comprised within (countenanced by) the Veda. The Sūtra means to say that by the demolition given above of the Sānkhya doctrine which is not comprised within the Veda the remaining theories which are in the same position, viz. the theories of Kaṇāda, Akshapāda, Jina, and Buddha, must likewise be considered as demolished.</description>

      <description>Earth on account of the subject-matter, the colour, and other texts. That the word &amp;lsquo;food&amp;rsquo; denotes the earth is to be inferred from the fact that the section in which the word occurs has for its subject-matter the creation of the elements; as everything eatable is a product of the earth, the term denoting the effect is there applied to denote the cause. In the same chapter, where the colour of the elements is mentioned (&amp;lsquo;The red colour of a flame is the colour of fire, the white one that of water, the black one that of food &amp;lsquo;), the collocation of words clearly shows that &amp;lsquo;food&amp;rsquo; means something of the same kind as fire and water, viz.</description>

      <description>But the rule (over the prāṇas) on the part of Fire and the rest, together with him to whom the prāṇa belong (i.e. the soul), is owing to the thinking of that (viz. the highest Self); on account of scriptural statement. It has been shown that the prāṇas, together with the main prāṇa, originate from Brahman, and have a limited size. That the prāṇas are guided by Agni and other divine beings has also been explained on a previous occasion, viz.</description>

Moreover, the followers of one śākhā explicitly teach that the connexion with one and the same body is for the individual soul a source of disadvantage, while for the highest Brahman it is nothing of the kind, but constitutes an accession of glory in so far as it manifests him as a Lord and Ruler, &amp;lsquo;Two birds, inseparable friends, cling to the same tree.

      <description>Not so, on account of non-specification. Nor is it true that the text &amp;lsquo;Doing works here,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., is meant to divert him who knows the Self from knowledge and restrict him to works. For there is no special reason to hold that that text refers to works as independent means of a desirable result: it may as well be understood to refer to works merely subordinate to knowledge. As he who knows the Self has to practise meditation as long as he lives, he may also have to practise, for the same period, works that are helpful to meditation.</description>

Having, so far, elucidated the nature of meditation, the Sūtras now begin to consider the result of meditation.

Here the philosopher who holds the Pradhāna to be the general cause comes forward with another objection. The Vedānta-texts, he says, do not teach that creation proceeds from one and the same agent only, and you therefore have no right to hold that Brahman is the sole cause of the world.</description>

The Sānkhya here comes forward with a new objection. You maintain, he says, that the highest Brahman has the character either of a cause or an effect according as it has for its body sentient and non-sentient beings in either their subtle or gross state; and that this explains the difference in nature between the individual soul and Brahman.</description>

      <description>And on account of (the atoms) having colour and so on, the reverse (takes place); as it is observed. From the view that the atoms of four kinds&amp;ndash;viz. of earth or water or fire or air&amp;ndash;possess colour, taste, smell, and touch, it would follow that the atoms are non-eternal, gross, and made up of parts&amp;ndash;and this is the reverse of what the Vaiśeshikas actually teach as to their atoms, viz.</description>

      <description>And on account of the eternity of this. As the quality, inhering in all things, of being ruled by the highest Self, is eternal and definitely fixed by being connected with his essential nature, it is an unavoidable conclusion that the rule of the soul and of the divinities over the organs depends on the will of the highest Self. The text, &amp;lsquo;Having sent forth this he entered into it, having entered into it he became sat and tyat&amp;rsquo; (Taitt.</description>

      <description>For (Brahman is) without form merely, since it is the principal agent with regard to that. Brahman, although by entering into bodies, human, divine, and so on, it becomes connected with various forms, yet is in itself altogether devoid of form, and therefore does not share that subjection to karman which in the case of the soul is due to its embodiedness.&amp;ndash;Why?&amp;ndash;Because as it is that which brings about names and forms it stands to them in the relation of a superior (pradhāna).</description>

      <description>For meditation, owing to the absence of purpose. As no other purpose can be assigned, the text must be supposed to represent Brahman as having joy for its head, and so on, for the purpose of meditation.

      <description>Or the permission is for the purpose of glorification. The or has assertive force. The introductory words of the Upanishad, &amp;lsquo;Hidden in the Lord is all this,&amp;rsquo; show knowledge to be the subject-matter; hence the permission of works can aim only at the glorification of knowledge. The sense of the text therefore is&amp;ndash;owing to the power of

      <description>Of the other also there is thus non-clinging; but at death. It has been said that, owing to knowledge, earlier and subsequent sins do not cling and are destroyed. The same holds good also with regard to the other, i.e. to good works&amp;ndash;they also, owing to knowledge, do not cling and are destroyed; for there is the same antagonism between knowledge and the fruit of those works, and Scripture moreover expressly declares this.</description>

      <description>With the Highest; for thus it says. It has been shown that at the time of departure from the body the soul together with the organs and prāṇas unites itself with the subtle elements, fire and the rest; and the notion that the soul of him who knows forms an exception has been disposed of. The further question now arises whether those subtle elements move on towards producing their appropriate effects, in accordance with the works or the nature of meditation (of some other soul with which those elements join themselves), or unite themselves with the highest Self.</description>

When, on the other hand,the released soul possesses a body created by its own will, then it enjoys its various delights in the same way as a waking man does.&amp;ndash;In the same way as the highest Person creates out of himself, for his own delight, the world of the Fathers and so on; so he sometimes creates such worlds for the enjoyment of the released souls.</description>

In continuation of the passage &amp;lsquo;It is the Self free from Sin,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., which refers to the small ether, the text says: &amp;lsquo;it is a bank, a limitary support, that these worlds may not be confounded.&amp;rsquo; What the text here says about the small ether supporting the world proves it to be the highest Brahman; for to support the world is the glory of Brahman.</description>

      <description>From connexion. The fact is that Brahman intelligent, consisting of bliss, &amp;amp;c., connects itself also with the passage &amp;lsquo;Non-being was this in the beginning&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 7). For the section of the text which precedes that passage (viz. &amp;lsquo;Different from this Self consisting of understanding is the Self consisting of Bliss;&amp;ndash;he wished, may I be many;&amp;ndash;he created all whatever there is. Having created he entered into it; having entered it he became sat and tyat&amp;rsquo;) clearly refers to Brahman consisting of Bliss, which realises its purposes, creates all beings, and entering into them is the Self of all.</description>

      <description>The non-difference (of the world) from that (viz. Brahman) follows from what begins with the word ārambhana. Under II, 1, 7 and other Sūtras the non-difference of the effect, i.e. the world from the cause, i.e. Brahman was assumed, and it was on this basis that the proof of Brahman being the cause of the world proceeded. The present Sūtra now raises a primā facie objection against that very non-difference, and then proceeds to refute it.</description>

      <description>And as there are objections in both cases. A difficulty arises not only on the view of the atoms having colour and other sensible qualities, but also on the view of their being destitute of those qualities. For as the qualities of effected things depend on the qualities of their causes, earth, water, and so on, would in that case be destitute of qualities. And if to avoid this difficulty, it be held that the atoms do possess qualities, we are again met by the difficulty stated in the preceding Sūtra.</description>

      <description>But the order of succession (which is stated) in reverse order (of the true one) is possible, (only if the origination of all effects is) thence (i.e. from Brahman).
The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; has an asseverative sense. The direct origination from Brahman of all effects&amp;ndash;which in passages such as the one quoted by the Pūrvapakshin is stated in a form the reverse of the (true) order of origination according to which the Unevolved, the Mahat, the ahankāra, Ether, and so on, succeed each other&amp;ndash;is possible only on the supposition of the origination of each effect being really from Brahman itself in the form of a special causal substance.</description>

      <description>They, with the exception of the best, are organs, on account of being so designated. Are all principles called prāṇas to be considered as &amp;lsquo;organs&amp;rsquo; (indriyāṇi), or is the &amp;lsquo;best,&amp;rsquo; i.e. the chief prāṇa, to be excepted?&amp;ndash;All of them, without exception, are organs; for they all are called prāṇas equally, and they all are instruments of the soul.&amp;ndash;Not so, the Sūtra replies. The &amp;lsquo;best&amp;rsquo; one is to be excepted, since only the prawas other than the best are designated as organs.</description>

In order that texts such as &amp;rsquo;the True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman&amp;rsquo; may not be devoid of meaning, we have to admit that light (intelligence) constitutes the essential nature of Brahman.

      <description>Some also, by proceeding according to their liking. In some śākhās, moreover, we read that he who possesses the knowledge of Brahman may, according to his liking, give up the state of a householder, &amp;lsquo;What shall we do with offspring, we who have this Self and this world?&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. V, 4, 22.) This text also proves knowledge not to be subsidiary to works; for if it were so subsidiary, it would not be possible for him who knows Brahman to give up householdership (with all the works obligatory on that state) according to his liking.</description>

      <description>But only those former works the effects of which have not yet begun; on account of that being the term. A new doubt arises here, viz. whether all previous good and evil works are destroyed by the origination of knowledge, or only those the effects of which have not yet begun to operate.&amp;ndash;All works alike, the Pūrvapakshin says; for the texts-as e.g. &amp;lsquo;all sins are burned&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;declare the fruits
of knowledge to be the same in all cases; and the fact of the body continuing to exist subsequently to the rise of knowledge may be accounted for by the force of an impulse once imparted, just as in the case of the revolution of a potter&amp;rsquo;s wheel.</description>

Is this union with the highest Self to be understood as ordinary &amp;lsquo;merging,&amp;rsquo; i.e. a return on the part of the effected thing into the condition of the cause (as when the jar is reduced to the condition of a lump of clay), or as absolute non-division from the highest Self, such as is meant in the clauses preceding the text last quoted, &amp;lsquo;Speech is merged in mind&amp;rsquo;?</description>

      <description>And Scripture declares the difference. The text, &amp;lsquo;He who meditates on name as Brahman, for him there is movement as he wishes as far as name extends,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Cḥ. Up. VII, 1 ff.), declares that those who meditate on the series of symbols beginning with name and ending with prāṇa attain to a result of limited nature and not depending on any particular path. Those therefore who meditate on the Intelligent either as mixed with the Non-intelligent or by itself, viewing it either under the aspect of Brahman or as separated from Brahman, are not led on by the conducting deities.</description>

      <description>The entering is as in the case of a lamp; for thus Scripture declares. Just as a lamp, although abiding in one place only, enters through the light proceeding from it into connexion with many places; so the soul also, although limited to one place, may through its light-like consciousness enter into several bodies. It may do this as well as in this life the soul, although abiding in one spot of the body only, viz.</description>

      <description>And on account of the settled meaning. The word &amp;rsquo;ether,&amp;rsquo; moreover, is known to have, among
other meanings, that of Brahman. Compare &amp;lsquo;For who could breathe, who could breathe forth, if that ether were not bliss?&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 7); &amp;lsquo;All these beings take their rise from the ether&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. I, 9, 1). It has to be kept in view that in the text under discussion the meaning &amp;lsquo;Brahman&amp;rsquo; is supported by what is said about the qualities of the small ether&amp;ndash;viz.</description>

      <description>Because it denotes the world. The Sānkhya comes forward with a further objection. Although the Vedānta-texts teach an intelligent principle to be the cause of the world, they do not present to us as objects of knowledge anything that could be the cause of
the world, apart from the Pradhāna and the soul as established by the Sānkhya-system. For the Kaushītakins declare in their text, in the dialogue of Bālāki and Ajātaśatru, that none but the enjoying(individual) soul is to be known as the cause of the world, &amp;lsquo;Shall I tell you Brahman?</description>

      <description>And because (the cause) is perceived in the existence of the effect. This means&amp;ndash;because gold which is the cause is perceived in the existence of its effects, such as earrings and the like; i.e. on account of the recognition of gold which expresses itself in the judgment &amp;rsquo;this earring is gold.&amp;rsquo; We do not on the other hand perceive the presence of clay, and so on, in gold, and so on.</description>

      <description>And as it is not accepted, it is altogether disregarded. Kapila&amp;rsquo;s doctrine, although to be rejected on account of it&amp;rsquo;s being in conflict with Scripture and sound reasoning, yet recommends itself to the adherents of the Veda on some accounts&amp;ndash;as e.g. its view of the existence of the effect in the cause. Kaṇāda&amp;rsquo;s theory, on the other hand, of which no part can be accepted and which is totally destitute of proof, cannot but be absolutely disregarded by all those who aim at the highest end of man.</description>

      <description>If it be said that knowledge and mind (which are mentioned) between (breath and the elements) (are stated) in order of succession, owing to an inferential mark of this; we say, not so, on account of non-difference. &amp;lsquo;Knowledge&amp;rsquo; in the Sūtra denotes the means of knowledge, i.e. the sense-organs.&amp;ndash;An objection is raised against the conclusion arrived at under the preceding Sūtra.

Texts such as &amp;lsquo;from him is born prāṇa, and the internal organ, and all organs&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3) mention the vital breath separately from the organs, and this shows that the breath is not one of the organs. The passage indeed mentions the internal organ (manas) also as something separate; but in other passages the manas is formally included in the organs, &amp;rsquo;the (five) organs with mind as the sixth&amp;rsquo; (Bha.</description>

      <description>On account of his activity there also, there is no contradiction. As their going to those seven places also is due to the command of Yama, there is no contradiction.&amp;ndash;Thus those also who do not perform sacrifices, and so on, after having gone to the world of Yama, and there undergone punishments
according to the nature of their works, later on ascend to the moon and again descend from there.</description>

Moreover the text &amp;rsquo;the True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman&amp;rsquo; only teaches that Brahman has light for its essential nature, and does not negative those other attributes of Brahman&amp;ndash;omniscience, being the cause of the world, &amp;amp;c.&amp;ndash;which are intimated by other texts.

      <description>And destruction. There is moreover a Vedānta-text which declares the knowledge of Brahman to destroy work-good and evil- which is the root of all the afflictions of transmigratory existence: &amp;lsquo;The knot of the heart is broken, all doubts are solved, all his works perish when He has been beheld who is high and low&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8). This also contradicts the view of knowledge being subordinate to works.</description>

      <description>But the Agnihotra and the rest, (because they tend) to that effect only; this being seen. It might here be said that special works incumbent on the several āśramas, as e. g. the Agnihotra, need not be undertaken by those who are not desirous of their results, since these works also fall under the category of good works the result of which does not &amp;lsquo;cling.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;This view the Sūtra sets aside.</description>

So far it has been shown that, up to the beginning of the journey, the souls of them as well who possess true knowledge as of those who do not, pass out of the body in the same way.</description>

      <description>It refers either to dreamless sleep or to union (sampatti); for this is manifested. Texts as the one last quoted do not refer to the released soul, but either to deep sleep or to &amp;lsquo;union&amp;rsquo; (sampatti), i.e. the time of dying; the latter in accordance with the text &amp;rsquo;then his speech is united (sampadyate) with his mind,&amp;ndash;heat with the highest divinity&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, 15, 1). In both those states the soul attains to the highest Self and is unconscious.</description>

      <description>If it be said that on account of reference to the other one he is meant; we say no, on account of impossibility. An objection is raised to the argumentation that, on account of complementary passages, the small ether must be explained to mean the highest Self.
For, the objector says, a clear reference to him who is &amp;lsquo;other&amp;rsquo; than the highest Self, i.e. to the individual soul, is contained in the following passage (VIII, 12, 3): &amp;lsquo;Thus does that serenity (samprasāda), having risen from this body and approached the highest light, appear in its own form.</description>

      <description>Should it be said that this is not so on account of the inferential marks of the individual soul and the chief vital air; we reply that this has been explained before. With reference to the plea urged by the Pūrvapakshin
that, owing to inferential marks pointing to the individual soul, and the circumstance of mention being made of the chief vital air, we must decide that the section treats of the enjoying individual soul and not of the highest Self, the Sūtra remarks that this argumentation has already been disposed of, viz.</description>

      <description>And on account of the existence of that which is posterior. On account of the existence of the posterior, i.e. the effect existing in the cause&amp;ndash;for this reason also the effect is non-different from the cause. For in ordinary language as well as in the Veda the effect is spoken of in terms of the cause; as when we say, &amp;lsquo;all these things&amp;ndash;jars, platters, &amp;amp;c.&amp;ndash;were clay only this morning&amp;rsquo;; or when the Veda says, &amp;lsquo;Being only was this in the beginning.</description>

      <description>Even on the aggregate with its two causes, there is non-establishment of that. We so far have refuted the Vaiseshikas, who hold the doctrine of atoms constituting the general cause. Now the followers of Buddha also teach that the world originates from atoms, and the Sūtras therefore proceed to declare that on their view also the origination, course, and so on, of the world cannot rationally be accounted for. These Bauddhas belong to four different classes.</description>

      <description>But that which abides in the things movable and immovable, i.e. the terms denoting those things, are non-secondary (i.e. of primary denotative power, viz. with regard to Brahman); since (their denotative power) is effected by the being of that (i.e. Brahman). The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; sets aside the objection raised. (The primā facie view here is as follows.) As Brahman, which has all things for its modes, is not the object of Perception and the other means of knowledge which give rise to the apprehension of the things only which are Brahman&amp;rsquo;s modes, and as hence, previously to the study of the Vedānta-texts, the idea of that to which the modes belong (i.</description>

      <description>But the making of names and forms (belongs) to him who renders tripartite, on account of scriptural teaching. The Sūtras have shown that the creation of the elements and organs in their collective aspect (samashṭi) and the activity of the individual souls proceed from the highest Self; and they have also further confirmed the view that the rule which the souls exercise over their organs depends on the highest Self.</description>

It cannot be admitted that those also who do not perform sacrifices, and so on, reach the moon; because the path of the gods and the path of the fathers are meant for the enjoyment of the fruits &amp;lsquo;of knowledge and work.&amp;lsquo;That is to say&amp;ndash;as those who do not perform sacrifices cannot ascend by the path of the gods, since they are destitute of knowledge; so they also cannot go by the path of the fathers, since they are destitute of meritorious works.</description>

      <description>(This Scripture) also shows, and it is also stated in Smr̥ti. That Brahman is a treasure as it were of all blessed qualities and free from all imperfections, the whole body of Vedānta-texts clearly declares: &amp;lsquo;That highest great lord of lords, that highest deity of deities&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;He is the cause, the lord of the lords of the organs, and there is of him neither parent nor lord &amp;lsquo;; &amp;lsquo;There is no effect and no cause known of him, no one is seen like unto him or higher.</description>

      <description>And of him who is chaste; for in Scripture (this is declared). The knowledge of Brahman belongs to those who have to observe chastity, and men living in that state have not to perform the Agnihotra, the Darśapūrṇamāsa, and similar works. For this reason also knowledge cannot be subsidiary to works.&amp;ndash;But, it may be objected, there is no such condition of life; for texts such as &amp;lsquo;he is to perform the Agnihotra as long as he lives,&amp;rsquo; declare men to be obliged to perform sacrifices and the like up to the end of their lives, and Smr̥ti texts contradicting Scripture have no authority.</description>

      <description>According to some (a class of good works) other than these, of both kinds. The text quoted above from one śākhā (&amp;lsquo;His friends enter upon his good deeds&amp;rsquo;) refers to good works other than the Agnihotra and the rest, the only object of which is to give rise to knowledge, viz. to all those manifold good works, previous or subsequent to the attaining to knowledge, the results of which are obstructed by other works of greater strength.</description>

      <description>Following the rays. Scripture teaches that the soul of him who knows, after having passed forth from the heart by way of the hundred and first artery, follows the rays of the sun and thus reaches the disc of the sun: &amp;lsquo;when he departs from this body he goes upwards by these rays only&amp;rsquo; (eva) (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 6, 5). The idea here suggests itself that the going of the soul cannot be exclusively bound&amp;rsquo; to those rays, since when a man dies during the night it cannot follow tae rays of the sun.</description>

      <description>With the exception of world-energy; on account of leading subject-matter and of non-proximity. The doubt here presents itself whether the power of the released soul is a universal power such as belongs to the Supreme Person, extending to the creation, sustentation, and so on, of the worlds; or is limited to the intuition of the Supreme Person.&amp;ndash;The Pūrvapakshin maintains the former view. For he says Scripture declares that the soul reaches equality with the Supreme Person: &amp;lsquo;Free from stain he reaches the highest equality&amp;rsquo; (Mu.</description>

      <description>Should it be said that from a subsequent passage (it appears that the individual Soul is meant); rather (the soul) in so far as its true nature has become manifest. The Pūrvapakshin now maintains that we ascertain from a subsequent declaration made by Prajāpati that it is just the individual Soul that possesses freedom from sin and the other qualities enumerated. The whole teaching of Prajāpati, he says, refers to the individual Soul only.</description>

The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; is meant to preclude the idea that the mention made of the individual soul enables us to understand the whole section as concerned with that soul.&amp;ndash;The teacher Jaimini is of opinion that the mention made of the individual soul has another meaning, i.e. aims at conveying the idea of what is different from the individual soul, i.</description>

      <description>Not the Self, on account of scriptural statement, and on account of the eternity (which results) from them. The Sūtras so far have stated that this entire world, from Ether downwards, originates from the highest Brahman. It now becomes a matter for discussion whether the individual soul also originates in the same way or not.&amp;ndash;It does so originate, the Pūrvapakshin maintains. For on this assumption only the scriptural statement as to the cognition of all things through the cognition of one thing holds good, and moreover Scripture declares that before creation everything was one.</description>

The view that the description of tripartition, given in the passage &amp;rsquo;each of these he made tripartite,&amp;rsquo; refers to a time subsequent to the creation of the mundane egg and to the gods created by Brahmā, cannot be upheld.

      <description>Not in the case of the third (place), as it is thus perceived. The third &amp;lsquo;place&amp;rsquo; does not, for the origination of a new body, depend on the fifth oblation. The term,&amp;rsquo;the third
place,&amp;rsquo; denotes mere evil-doers. That these do not, for the origination of a new body, depend on the fifth oblation, is seen from Scripture. For, in answer to the question &amp;lsquo;Do you know why that world never becomes full?</description>

      <description>For this very reason comparisons, such as reflected images of the sun and the like. Because Brahman, although abiding in manifold places, ever possesses the twofold characteristics, and hence does not share the imperfections due to those places, scriptural texts illustrate its purity in the midst of inferior surroundings by comparing it to the sun reflected in water, mirrors, and the like. Compare e.g., &amp;lsquo;As the one ether is rendered manifold by jars and the like, or as the one sun becomes manifold in several sheets of water; thus the one Self is rendered manifold by abiding in many places.</description>

      <description>The new (thing is enjoined); on account of the statement of what has to be done. The Sūtra discusses an additional question connected with the meditation on breath. Both texts&amp;ndash;the Cḥāndogya as well as the Vājasaneyaka-declare that water constitutes a dress for praṇa, and refer to the rinsing of the mouth
with water. The doubt here arises whether what the texts mean to enjoin is the rinsing of the mouth, or a meditation on prāṇa as having water for its dress.</description>

      <description>A reference (only) Jaimini (holds them to be), on account of absence of injunction; for (Scripture) forbids. The argument for the three stages of life, founded on their mention in Vedic texts, has no force, since all those references are only of the nature of anuvāda. For none of those texts contain injunctive forms. The text &amp;lsquo;There are three branches of sacred observance,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Cḥ. Up. II, 23, 1), is meant to glorify the previous meditation on Brahman under the form of the pra«ava, as appears from the concluding clause &amp;lsquo;he who is firmly grounded in Brahman obtains immortality&amp;rsquo;; it therefore cannot mean to enjoin the three conditions of life as valid states.</description>

We thus arrive at the conclusion that the text of the Sāṭyāyanins,&amp;rsquo; his friends enter upon his good works,&amp;rsquo; refers to those good works of the man possessing knowledge the results of which were somehow obstructed (and hence did not act themselves out during his lifetime, so that on his death they may be transferred to others).</description>

      <description>Should it be said, not in the night; we say, no; because the connexion persists as long as the body does. Scripture also declares this. It is now enquired into whether the soul of him who, while having true knowledge, dies at night reaches Brahman or not. Although, as solar rays exist at night, the soul may move on at night also following those rays; yet, since dying at night is spoken of in the Sūtras as highly objectionable, we conclude that he who dies at night cannot accomplish the highest end of man, viz.</description>

      <description>If it be said that this is not so, on account of direct teaching; we reply not so, on account of the texts declaring that which abides within the spheres of those entrusted with special functions. But, an objection is raised, certain texts directly declare that the released soul also possesses &amp;lsquo;world-energy.&amp;rsquo; Compare &amp;lsquo;He becomes a self-ruler; he moves in all worlds according to his wishes &amp;rsquo; (Cḥ.

      <description>And the reference has a different meaning. The text in question declares that the released individual soul when reaching the highest light, i.e. Brahman, which is free from all sin, and so on, attains its true nature, which is characterised by similar freedom from sin, and so on. Now this reference to the individual soul, as described in the teaching of Prajāpati, has the purpose of giving instruction (not about the qualities of the individual soul, but) about the nature of that which is the cause of the qualities of the individual soul, i.</description>

      <description>On account of the connected meaning of the sentences. In spite of the conclusion arrived at there may remain a suspicion that here and there in the Upanishads texts are to be met with which aim at setting forth the soul as maintained in Kapila&amp;rsquo;s system, and that hence there is no room for a being different from the individual soul and called Lord. This suspicion the Sūtra undertakes to remove, in connexion with the Maitreyi-brāhmaṇa, in the Br̥hadaraṇyaka.</description>

For the following reason also the origination of the world cannot be accounted for on the view of the momentariness of all existence. At the time when the subsequent momentary existence originates, the preceding momentary existence has passed away, and it cannot therefore stand in a causal relation towards the subsequent one. For if non-existence had causal power, anything might originate at any time at any place.</description>

      <description>For this very reason (the individual soul is) a knower. It has been shown that, different therein from Ether and the rest, the soul is not produced. This leads to the consideration of the soul&amp;rsquo;s essential nature. Is that essential nature constituted by mere intelligence as Sugata and Kapila hold; or is the soul as Kaṇāda thinks, essentially non-intelligent, comparable to a stone, while intelligence is merely an adventitious quality of it; or is it essentially a knowing subject?</description>

The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; indicates an objection.&amp;ndash;The highest Self is not apprehended in earth and other places in the same way as the sun or a face is apprehended in water or a mirror. For the sun and a face are erroneously apprehended as abiding in water or a mirror; they do not really abide there. When, on the other hand, Scripture tells us that the highest Self dwells in the earth, in water, in the soul, &amp;amp;c.</description>

      <description>And (the qualities) thus being equal, on account of non-difference. In the book of the Vājasaneyaka, called Agnirahasya, we meet with a meditation on Brahman called Śāṇḍilyavidyā; and there is also a Śāṇḍilya-vidyā in the Br̥hadāraṇyaka . The Pūrvapakshin holds that these two meditations are different since the latter text mentions qualities&amp;ndash;such as Brahman being the lord of all&amp;ndash;which are not mentioned in the former; the objects of meditation thus being different, the meditations themselves are different.</description>

      <description>It is to be accomplished, Bādarayaṇa holds, on account of scriptural statement of equality. Bādarāyaṇa is of opinion that, in the same way as the condition of householdership, those other conditions of life also are obligatory; since in the section beginning &amp;rsquo;there are three branches of sacred duty&amp;rsquo; all the three conditions of life are equally referred to, with a view to glorifying him who is firmly grounded in Brahman.</description>

      <description>But having destroyed by fruition the other two sets he becomes one with Brahman. There now arises the doubt whether the good and evil
works other than those the non-clinging and destruction of which have been declared, that is to say those works the results of which have begun to act, come to an end together with that bodily existence in which knowledge of Brahman originates, or with the last body due to the action of the works last mentioned, or with another body due to the action of the anārabdhakārya.</description>

      <description>For the same reason also during the southern progress of the sun. The reasoning stated above also proves that the owner of true knowledge who may happen to die during the southern progress of the sun reaches Brahman. A further doubt, however, arises here. The text &amp;lsquo;He who dies during the sun&amp;rsquo;s southern progress reaches the greatness of the Fathers and union with the moon&amp;rsquo; (Mahānār. Up. 25) declares that he who dies during the southern progress reaches the moon; and the other text &amp;lsquo;when this ceases they return again the same way&amp;rsquo; (Br̥.</description>

      <description>That which is not within change; for thus Scripture declares the abiding (of the soul). That which is not within change, i.e. the highest Brahman which is free from all change and of an absolutely perfect and blessed nature&amp;ndash;this, together with the manifestations of its glory, is what forms the object of consciousness for the released soul. The worlds which are subject to change thus form objects for that soul&amp;rsquo;s experience, in so far as they form part of Brahman&amp;rsquo;s manifestation.</description>

      <description>If it be said, owing to the scriptural declaration of smallness; that has been explained. The text describes the ether within the heart as being of small compass, and this agrees indeed with the individual soul which elsewhere is compared to the point of an awl, but not with Brahman, which is greater than everything.&amp;ndash;The reply to this objection has virtually been given before, viz. under I, 2, 7, where it is said that Brahman may be viewed as of small size, for the purpose of devout meditation.</description>

      <description>(It is) a mark indicating that the promissory statement is proved; thus Āśmarathya thinks. According to the teacher Āśmarathya the circumstance that terms denoting the individual soul are used to denote Brahman is a mark enabling us to infer that the promissory declaration according to which through the knowledge of one thing everything is known is well established. If the individual soul were not identical with Brahman in so far as it is the effect of Brahman, then the knowledge of the soul&amp;ndash;being something distinct from Brahman&amp;ndash;would not follow from the knowledge of the highest Self.</description>

      <description>And as the different vital airs. As the one air, according as it undergoes in the body
different modifications, acquires a new name, new characteristics, and new functions, being then called prāṇa, apāna, and so on; thus the one Brahman becomes the world, with its manifold moving and non-moving beings.&amp;ndash;The non-difference of the world from Brahman, the highest cause, is thus fully established.

      <description>There not being (a cause), there results contradiction of the admitted principle; otherwise simultaneousness. If it be said that the effect may originate even when a cause does not exist, then&amp;ndash;as we have pointed out before&amp;ndash;anything might originate anywhere and at any time. And not only would the origination of the effect thus remain unexplained, but an admitted principle would also be contradicted. For you hold the principle that there are four causes bringing about the origination of a cognition, viz.</description>

      <description>On account of (its) passing out, moving and returning. The Self is not omnipresent, but on the contrary, of atomic size (aṇu).&amp;ndash;How is this known?&amp;ndash;Since Scripture says that it passes out, goes and returns. Its passing out is described in the following passage &amp;lsquo;by that light this Self departs, either through the eye, or through the skull, or through other parts of the body&amp;rsquo; (B_ri._ Up. IV, 4, 2). Its going in the following text &amp;lsquo;all those who pass away out of this world go to the moon,&amp;rsquo; and its returning in the text &amp;lsquo;from that world he comes again into this world, for action.</description>

      <description>And on account of its being seen. And it is seen in Scripture also, that the bodies of some beings originate independently of the fifth oblation: &amp;lsquo;Of all beings there are indeed three origins only, that which springs from an egg, that which springs from a living being, that which springs from a germ&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VI, 3, 1). It is observed that from among these beings those springing from a germ and those springing from heat originate without that fifth oblation.</description>

The comparison of the highest Self to the reflected sun and the rest is meant only to deny of the Self that it participates in the imperfections&amp;ndash;such as increase, decrease, and the like&amp;ndash;which attach to the earth and the other beings within which the Self abides.</description>

      <description>On account of connexion, thus elsewhere also. In the Br̥had-āraṇyaka (V, 5) it is said that Brahman is to be meditated upon as abiding within the orb of the sun and within the right eye; and then the text mentions two secret names of Brahman&amp;ndash;aham and ahar.

      <description>Or an injunction, as in the case of the carrying. As the second part of the text &amp;lsquo;Let him approach carrying the firewood below the ladle; for above he carries
it for the gods&amp;rsquo; (which refers to a certain form of the Agnihotra), although having the form of an anuvāda, yet must be interpreted as an injunction, since the carrying of firewood above is not established by any other injunction; so the text under discussion also must be taken as an injunction of the different stages of life (which are not formally enjoined elsewhere).</description>

      <description>And those two (paths) are, with a view to the Yogins, mentioned as to be remembered. The text quoted does not state an injunction for those about to die, of a special time of death; but there are rather mentioned in it those two matters belonging to Smr̥ti and therefore to be remembered, viz. the two paths&amp;ndash;the path of the Gods and the path of the Fathers&amp;ndash;with a view to those who know and practise Yoga; the text intimating that Yogins should daily think of those paths which are included in Yoga meditation.</description>

      <description>And on account of the imitation of that. The individual soul, free from bondage, and thus possessing the qualities of freedom from sin, &amp;amp;c., cannot be the small ether, i.e. the highest Brahman, because it is stated to &amp;lsquo;imitate,&amp;rsquo; i.e. to be equal to that Brahman. The text making that statement is Mu. Up. III, 1, 3, &amp;lsquo;When the seer (i.e. the individual soul) sees the brilliant maker, the Lord, the Person who has his source in Brahman; then becoming wise and shaking off good and evil, he reaches the highest equality, free from passions.</description>

      <description>There is non-establishment of pratisankhyā and apratisankhyā destruction, on account of non-interruption.
So far the hypothesis of origination from that which is not has been refuted. The present Sūtra now goes on to declare that also the absolute (niranvaya) destruction of that which is cannot rationally be demonstrated. Those who maintain the momentariness of all things teach that there are two kinds of destruction, one of a gross kind, which consists in the termination of a series of similar momentary existences, and is capable of being perceived as immediately resulting from agencies such as the blow of a hammer (breaking a jar, e.</description>

      <description>And on account of the latter two (being effected) through the Self. The &amp;lsquo;and&amp;rsquo; has affirming power. The &amp;lsquo;passing out&amp;rsquo; might somehow be reconciled with a non-moving Self (such as the omnipresent Self would be) if it were taken in the sense of the Self separating from the body; but for the going and returning no analogous explanation is possible. They, therefore, must be taken as effected by the Self itself (which, then, cannot be omnipresent and non-moving).</description>

      <description>For the text denies the previously declared so-muchness; and declares more than that. It is impossible to understand the text &amp;rsquo;not so, not so&amp;rsquo; as negativing those distinctions of Brahman which had been stated previously. If the text meant that, it would be mere idle talk. For none but a person not in his right mind would first teach that all the things mentioned in the earlier part of the section are distinctive attributes of Brahman&amp;ndash;as which they are not known by any other</description>

      <description>Or not so, on account of difference. This is not so, for as Brahman is to be meditated upon in two different abodes, the meditations are separate. In both the Śāṇḍilya-vidyās, on the other hand, Brahman is to be meditated upon as abiding within the heart.</description>

      <description>If it be said that they are mere glorification, on account of their reference; not so, on account of the newness. The following point is next enquired into. Are texts such as &amp;lsquo;That Udgītha is the best of all essences, the highest, holding the supreme place, the eighth&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. I, 1, 3) meant to glorify the Udgītha as a constituent element of the sacrifice, or to enjoin a meditation on the Udgītha as the best of all essences, and so on?</description>

      <description>And on account of the indication of the equality of enjoyment only. The previous conclusion is confirmed by the further fact that the text directly teaches the released soul to be equal to Brahman in so far only as enjoying direct insight into the true nature of Brahman. &amp;lsquo;He reaches all objects of
desire, together with the all-knowing Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1).&amp;ndash;The conclusion thus is that we have to shape our ideas as to the powers of the released soul in accordance with what the texts say as to the Lord only possessing the power of ruling and controlling the entire world, and that hence the latter power cannot be attributed to the soul.</description>

      <description>The same is declared by Smr̥ti also. Smr̥ti also declares that the transmigrating soul when reaching the state of Release &amp;lsquo;imitates,&amp;rsquo; i.e. attains supreme equality of attributes with the highest Brahman. &amp;lsquo;Abiding by this knowledge they, attaining to equality of attributes with me, are not born again at the time of creation, nor are they affected by the general dissolution of the world&amp;rsquo; (Bha. Gī. XIV, 2).

      <description>On account of (Brahman&amp;rsquo;s) abiding (within the individual soul); thus Kāśakr̥tsna (holds). We must object likewise to the view set forth in the preceding Sūtra, viz. that Brahman is denoted by terms denoting the individual soul because that soul when departing becomes one with Brahman. For that view cannot stand the test of being submitted to definite alternatives.&amp;ndash;Is the soul&amp;rsquo;s not being such, i.e. not being Brahman, previously to its departure from the body, due to its own essential nature or to a limiting adjunct, and is it in the latter case real or unreal?</description>

      <description>But (Brahman is) additional, on account of the declaration of difference. The word &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; sets aside the primā facie view. To the individual soul capable of connexion with the various kinds of pain there is additional, i.e. from it there is different, Brahman.&amp;ndash;On what ground?&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Owing to the declaration of difference.&amp;rsquo; For Brahman is spoken of as different from the soul in the following texts:&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;He who dwells in the Self and within the Self, whom the Self does not know, of whom the Self is the body, who rules the Self within, he is thy Self, the ruler within, the immortal&amp;rsquo; (Br̥.</description>

      <description>And on account of the objections presenting themselves in either case. It has been shown that neither origination from nothing, as held by the advocates of general momentariness, is possible; nor the passing away into nothing on the part of the thing originated. The acknowledgment of either of these views gives rise to difficulties. If the effect originates from nothing, it is itself of the nature of nothing; for it is observed that effects share the nature of what they originate from.</description>

      <description>If it be said that (the soul) is not atomic, on account of scriptural statement of (what is) not that; we say no, on account of the other one being the topic. The passage &amp;lsquo;He who is within the heart, surrounded by the Prāṇas, the person consisting of knowledge&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 3, 7) introduces as the topic of discussion the personal Self, and further on in the same chapter we read &amp;rsquo;the unborn Self, the great one&amp;rsquo; (IV, 4, 22).</description>

      <description>There is entering into similarity of being with those, there being a reason. The text describes the manner in which those who perform sacrifices, and so on, descend from the moon as follows: &amp;lsquo;They return again that way as they came, to the ether, from the ether to the air. Then having become air they become smoke, having become smoke they become mist,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. The doubt here arises whether the soul when reaching ether, and so on, becomes ether in the same sense as here on earth it becomes a man or other being, or merely becomes similar to ether, and so on.</description>

      <description>The text also declares this. That the qualities of that which abides within the sun and that which abides in the eye are not to be combined, the text itself moreover shows by specially stating that the characteristics of the one are those of the other. For such a special transfer of qualities is needed only where the qualities are not of themselves established, i.e. where the two things are naturally different.</description>

      <description>Non-return, according to Scripture; non-return, according to Scripture. We know from Scripture that there is a Supreme Person whose nature is absolute bliss and goodness; who is fundamentally antagonistic to all evil; who is the cause of the origination, sustentation, and dissolution of the world; who differs in nature from all other beings, who is all-knowing, who by his mere thought and will accomplishes all his purposes; who is an ocean of kindness as it were for all who depend on him; who is all-merciful; who is immeasurably raised above all possibility of any one being equal or superior to him; whose name is the highest Brahman.</description>

      <description>(Brahman is) the material cause on account of this not being in conflict with the promissory statements and the illustrative instances. The claims raised by the atheistic Sānkhya having thus been disposed of, the theistic Sānkhya comes forward as an opponent. It must indeed be admitted, he says, that the Vedānta-texts teach the cause of the world to be an all-knowing Lord; for they attribute to that cause thought and similar characteristics.</description>

      <description>And as in the analogous case of stones and the like, there is impossibility of that. In the same way as it is impossible that the different non-sentient things such as stones, iron, wood, herbs, &amp;amp;c., which are of an extremely low constitution and subject to constant change, should be one in nature with Brahman, which is faultless, changeless, fundamentally antagonistic to all that is evil, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c.; so it is also impossible that the individual soul, which is liable to endless suffering, and a mere wretched glowworm as it were, should be one with Brahman who, as we know from the texts, comprises within himself the treasure of all auspicious qualities, &amp;amp;c.</description>

      <description>And in the case of space also, on account of there being no difference. In order to prove the permanency of external and internal things, we have disproved the view that the two forms of destruction called pratisankhyā and apratisankhyā mean reduction of an existing thing to nothing. This gives us an opportunity to disprove the view of Ether(space) being likewise a mere irrational non-entity, as the Bauddhas hold it to be.</description>

III, 1, 9).&amp;ndash;By the term &amp;lsquo;unmāna&amp;rsquo; in the Sūtra we have to understand measurement by selection of comparative instances.
Scripture declares the minuteness of the individual Self by reference to things which are like atoms in size, &amp;lsquo;The individual soul is to be known as part of the hundredth part of the point of a hair divided a hundred times, and yet it is to be infinite&amp;rsquo; (Śvet.</description>

      <description>Not very long; on account of special statement. Does the soul in its descent through ether, and so on, stay at each stage for a not very long time, or is there nothing to define that time?&amp;ndash;It stays at each stage for an indefinite time, there being nothing to define the time.&amp;ndash;
Not so, the Sūtra decides. For there is a special statement, i.e. the text says that when the soul has become rice or grain or the like, the passing out of that stage is beset with difficulties.</description>

      <description>Also in perfect conciliation, according to Scripture and Smr̥ti. Moreover, it is only in the state of perfect conciliation or endearment, i.e. in meditation bearing the character of devotion, that an intuition of Brahman takes place, not in any other state. This Scripture and Smr̥ti alike teach. &amp;lsquo;That Self cannot be gained by the Veda, nor by understanding, nor by much learning.

      <description>And for the same reason the holding together and the pervading the sky. In the Taittiriyaka and in the khilas of the Rāṇāyanīyas we have the following passage: &amp;lsquo;Gathered together are the powers among which Brahman is the oldest; Brahman as the oldest in the beginning stretched out the sky. Brahman was born as the first of all beings; who may rival that Brahman?&amp;rsquo; which declares that Brahman gathered together all the most ancient powers, that it pervades the sky, and so on.</description>

      <description>Should it be said that (the stories told in the Upanishads) are for the purpose of the Pāriplava; not so, since (certain stories) are specified. We meet in the Vedānta-texts with certain stories such as &amp;lsquo;Pratardana the son of Divodāsa came to the beloved abode of Indra,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., and similar ones. The question here arises whether the stories are merely meant to be recited at the Aśvamedha sacrifice or to convey knowledge of a special kind.</description>

      <description>But with reference to the heart, men being qualified. In so far as the highest Self abides, for the purpose of devout meditation, in the heart of the devotee&amp;ndash;which heart is of the measure of a thumb&amp;ndash;it may itself be viewed as having the measure of a thumb. The individual soul also can be said to have the measure of a thumb only in so far as dwelling within the heart; for scripture directly states that its real size is that of the point of a goad, i.</description>

      <description>And on account of the statement of reflection. Brahman must be held to be both causes for that reason also that texts such as &amp;lsquo;He desired, may I be many, may I grow forth,&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;It thought, may I be many, may I grow forth,&amp;rsquo; declare that the creative Brahman forms the purpose of its own Self multiplying itself. The text clearly teaches that creation on Brahman&amp;rsquo;s part is preceded by the purpose &amp;lsquo;May I, and no other than I, become manifold in the shape of various non-sentient and sentient beings.</description>

      <description>Should it be said that (it is) not, on account of the observation of employment; we say, not so; for as in the case of milk. We have so far determined that it is in no way unreasonable to hold that the highest Brahman, which is all-knowing, capable of realising its purposes, &amp;amp;c., has all beings, sentient and non-sentient, for its body, and hence constitutes the Self of all and differs in nature from everything else.</description>

      <description>There is no contradiction, as in the case of sandal-ointment. As a drop of sandal-ointment, although applied to one spot of the body only, yet produces a refreshing sensation extending over the whole body; thus the Self also, although dwelling in one part of the body only, is conscious of sensations taking place in any part of the body.</description>

      <description>Into (plants) animated by other souls, because the statement is as in the previous cases. The text declares that (he descending souls are born as rice, corn, &amp;amp;c., &amp;rsquo;they are born here as rice, corn, herbs, trees,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. The question here is whether the souls cling to plants animated by other souls which have those plants for their bodies; or whether the descending souls themselves are born with those plants for their bodies.</description>

      <description>And there is non-difference (of the intention of Brahman&amp;rsquo;s distinguishing attributes), as in the case of light; and the light (is) intuited as constituting Brahman&amp;rsquo;s essential nature by repetition of the practice (of meditation). That the clause &amp;rsquo;not so&amp;rsquo; negatives not Brahman&amp;rsquo;s possessing two forms, a material and an immaterial one, but only Brahman&amp;rsquo;s nature being restricted to those determinations, follows therefrom also that in the vision of Vāmadeva and others who had attained to intuition into Brahman&amp;rsquo;s nature, the fact of Brahman having all material and immaterial beings for its attributes is apprehended in non-difference, i.</description>

      <description>And although (they both be) meditations on man; on account of others not being recorded. In the Taittiriyaka as well as the Cḥāndogya we meet with a meditation on man (purusha-vidyā), in which parts of the sacrifice are fancifully identified with the parts of
the human body.&amp;ndash;Here the Pūrvapakshin maintains that these two meditations are identical; for, he says, both meditations have the same name (purusha-vidyā), and the same character as stated above; and as the Taittirīyaka mentions no fruit of the meditation, the fruit declared in the Cḥāndogya holds good for the Taittirīyaka also, and thus there is no difference of fruit.</description>

      <description>This follows also from the textual connexion (of those stories with injunctions). That those stories subserve injunctions of meditation is proved thereby also that they are exhibited in textual connexion with injunctions such as &amp;rsquo;the Self is to be seen,&amp;rsquo; and so on. Their position therefore is analogous to that of other stories told in the texts, which somehow subserve injunctions of works, and are not merely meant for purposes of recitation.</description>

      <description>Also beings above them (i.e. men), Bādarāyaṇa thinks, on account of possibility. In order to prove that the highest Brahman may be
viewed as having the size of a thumb, it has been declared that the scriptural texts enjoining meditation on Brahman are the concern of men. This offers an opportunity for the discussion of the question whether also other classes of individual souls, such as devas, are qualified for knowledge of Brahman.</description>

      <description>And on account of both being directly declared. The conclusion arrived at above is based not only on scriptural declaration, illustrative instances and statements of reflection; but in addition Scripture directly states that Brahman alone is the material as well as operative cause of the world. &amp;lsquo;What was the wood, what the tree from which they have shaped heaven and earth?

      <description>And as in the case of the gods and so on, in (their) world. As the gods and similar exalted beings create, each in his own world, whatever they require by their mere volition, so the Supreme Person creates by his mere volition the entire world. That the gods about whose powers we know from the Veda only (not through perception) are here quoted as supplying a proving instance, is done in order to facilitate the comprehension of the creative power of Brahman, which</description>

      <description>Not from non-entity, this not being observed. So far we have set forth the arguments refuting the views of the Vaibhāshikas as well as the Sautrāntikas&amp;ndash;both which schools maintain the reality of external things.&amp;ndash;Now the Sautrāntika comes forward and opposes one of the arguments set forth by us above, viz. that, on the view of general momentariness. nothing can ever become an object of cognition, since the thing which enters into connexion with the sense-organ is no longer in existence when the cognition originates.</description>

      <description>Should it be said (that this is not so) on account of specialisation of abode; we say no, on account of the acknowledgment (of a place of the Self), viz. in the heart. There is a difference. The drop of ointment can produce its effect as at any rate it is in contact with a definite part of the body. But we know of no such part in the case of the soul!</description>

      <description>It is unholy. Not so, on the ground of Scripture. The conclusion arrived at above cannot be accepted, since there is a reason why the descending soul should enter on the condition of an enjoying soul. Such works as sacrifices, the fruit of which is the enjoyment of the heavenly world, are mixed with evil, for they imply injury to living beings as in the case of the goat offered to Agnīshomau.</description>

      <description>Hence (Brahman is distinguished) by what is infinite; for thus the characteristics (hold good). By the arguments stated it is proved that Brahman is distinguished by the infinite multitude of blessed qualities. And this being so, it follows that Brahman possesses the twofold characteristics.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;that which has twofold characteristics.&#39;</description>

The Sūtras return, from their digression into the discussion of two special points, to the question as to those whose condition of life involves chastity. The above Sūtra declares that as persons of that class are referred to by Scripture as specially concerned with meditation (&amp;lsquo;He who is founded on Brahman reaches immortality;&amp;rsquo; &amp;rsquo;those who in the forest,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.</description>

      <description>If it be said that there results a contradiction to work; we deny this, on account of the observation of the assumption of several (bodies). An objection here presents itself. If we admit the gods to have bodies, a difficulty arises at the sacrifices, as it is impossible that one and the same corporeal Indra&amp;ndash;who is at the same time invited by many sacrificers &amp;lsquo;come,
O Indra&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;come, O Lord of the red horses,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.</description>

      <description>On account of (the Self) making itself. Of Brahman which the text had introduced as intent on creation, &amp;lsquo;He wished, may I be many&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 6), a subsequent text says, &amp;lsquo;That itself made its Self (II, 7), so that Brahman is represented as the object as well as the agent in the act of creation. It being the Self only which here is made many, we understand that the Self is material cause as well as operative one.</description>

      <description>And thus there would be accomplishment on the part of non-active people also. Thus, i.e. on the theory of universal momentariness, origination from the non-existent, causeless cognition, and so on, it would follow that persons also not making any efforts may accomplish all their ends. It is a fact that the attainment of things desired and the warding off of things not desired is effected through effort, and so on.</description>

      <description>After that conjunction with him who performs the act of generation. The declaration that the descending souls become rice plants, and so on, cannot be taken literally for that reason also, that the text afterwards declares them to become those who perform the act of generation: &amp;lsquo;Whoever the being may be that eats the food and begets offspring, that being he (i.e. the soul that has descended) becomes.&amp;rsquo; Now the meaning of this latter text can only be that the soul enters into conjunction with the creature which eats the grain; and hence we have to interpret the previous text, as to the soul&amp;rsquo;s becoming a plant, in the same way.</description>

      <description>But on account of twofold designation, as the snake and its coils. It has been shown in the preceding adhikaraṇa that
the entire non-sentient universe is the outward form of Brahman. For the purpose of proving Brahman&amp;rsquo;s freedom from all imperfection, an enquiry is now begun into the particular mode in which the world may be conceived to constitute the form of Brahman. Is the relation of the two like that of the snake and its coils; or like that of light and the luminous body, both of which fall under the same genus; or like that of the individual soul and Brahman, the soul being a distinguishing attribute and for that reason a part (aṁśa) of Brahman?</description>

      <description>But in the case of the getting rid of (it has to be combined with the obtaining), as it is supplementary to statements of obtaining; as in the case of the kuśas, the metres, the praise, and the singing. This has been explained.
The Cḥandogas read in their text &amp;lsquo;Shaking off all evil as a horse shakes his hair, and shaking off the body as the moon frees herself from the mouth of Rāhu, I obtain the world of Brahman &amp;rsquo; (Cḥ.</description>

      <description>And there is need of all (works), on account of the scriptural statement of sacrifices and the rest; as in the case of the horse.
If knowledge (meditation), without any reference to sacrifices and the like, is able to bring about immortality, it must be capable of accomplishing this in the case of householders also; and the mention made of sacrifices and the rest in texts such as &amp;lsquo;Brāhmaṇas seek to know him by the study of the Veda, by sacrifice, by gifts&amp;rsquo; (Br̥.</description>

      <description>If it be said (that a contradiction will result) with regard to words; we say no, since beings originate from them (as appears) from perception and inference. Well then let us admit that there is no difficulty as far as sacrifices are concerned, for the reason stated in the preceding Sūtra. But another difficulty presents itself with regard to the words of which the Veda consists. For if Indra and the other gods are corporeal beings, it follows that they are made up of parts and hence non-permanent.</description>

      <description>Owing to modification. This means&amp;ndash;owing to the essential nature of modification (pariṇāma). The modification taught in our system is not such as to introduce imperfections into the highest Brahman, on the contrary it confers on it limitless glory. For our teaching as to Brahman&amp;rsquo;s modification is as follows.
Brahman&amp;ndash;essentially antagonistic to all evil, of uniform goodness, differing in nature from all beings other than itself, all-knowing, endowed with the power of immediately realising all its purposes, in eternal possession of all it wishes for, supremely blessed&amp;ndash;has for its body the entire universe, with all its sentient and non-sentient beings&amp;ndash;the universe being for it a plaything as it were&amp;ndash;and constitutes the Self of the Universe.</description>

      <description>But on account of Scripture; (Brahman&amp;rsquo;s possession of various powers) being founded upon the word. The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; sets aside the difficulty raised. There is no
inappropriateness; &amp;lsquo;on account of Scripture.&amp;rsquo; Scripture declares on the one hand that Brahman is not made up of parts, and on the other that from it a multiform creation proceeds. And in matters vouched for by Scripture we must conform our ideas to what Scripture actually says.</description>

      <description>Not non-existence, on account of consciousness. Here now come forward the Yogācāras, who hold that cognitions(ideas) only are real. There is no reasonable ground, they say, for the view that the manifoldness of ideas is due to the manifoldness of things, since ideas themselves&amp;ndash;no less than the things assumed by others&amp;ndash;have their distinct forms, and hence are manifold. And this manifold nature of ideas is sufficiently explained by so-called vāsanā.</description>

      <description>There is distinction as in the case of smell; and thus Scripture declares. Just as smell, which is perceived as a quality of earth, is distinct from earth; thus knowledge of which we are conscious as the quality of a knowing subject&amp;ndash;which relation expresses itself in judgments such as &amp;lsquo;I know&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;is different from the knowing subject.

Only after having reached a yoni the soul, affected with a remnant of its works, obtains a new body, and only in a body there can be the enjoyment of pleasure and pain. When, therefore, previous to that the soul is said to reach ether, wind, and so on, this can only mean that it enters into conjunction with them.&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;that animated by another soul.</description>

      <description>At departing; there being nothing to be reached. For thus others (also declare). The further question arises whether the putting off of all good and evil deeds takes place only at the time when the soul leaves the body, or also after it has departed and is on its journey to the world of Brahman. The Pūrvapakshin holds the latter view, for, he says, the texts declare both. The Kaushītakins say that the soul shakes off its good and evil deeds when it crosses the river Virajā in the world of Brahman; while the Tāṇdins say &amp;lsquo;Shaking off all evil, and shaking off the body,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.</description>

      <description>But all the same he must be possessed of calmness, subjection of the senses, &amp;amp;c., since those are enjoined as auxiliaries to that, and must necessarily be accomplished. The question is whether the householder also must practise calmness and so on, or not. The Pūrvapakshin says he must not, since the performance of works implies the activity of the outer and inner organs of action, and since calmness and so on are of an exactly opposite nature.</description>

As words such as Indra and Vasishṭḥa, which denote gods and R̥shis, denote (not individuals only, but) classes, and as the creation of those beings is preceded by their being suggested to the creative mind through those words; for this reason the eternity of the Veda admits of being reconciled with what scripture says about the mantras and kāṇḍas (sections) of the sacred text having &amp;lsquo;makers&amp;rsquo; and about R̥shis seeing the hymns; cp.</description>

      <description>And thus in the Self; for (there are) manifold (powers). If attributes belonging to one thing were on that account to be ascribed to other things also, it would follow that attributes observed in non-sentient things, such as jars and the like, belong also to the intelligent eternal Self, which is of an altogether different kind. But that such attributes do not extend to the Self is due to the variety of the essential nature of things.</description>

Owing to the different nature of dream-cognitions, it cannot be said that, like them, the cognitions of the waking state also have no things to correspond to them. For dream-cognitions are originated by organs impaired by certain defects, such as drowsiness, and are moreover sublated by the cognitions of the waking state; while the cognitions of the waking state are of a contrary nature.</description>

IV, 3, 30).&amp;ndash;It has been said that in passages such as &amp;lsquo;he who abiding in knowledge&amp;rsquo; (B_ri._ Up.

      <description>Or else in the manner stated above. The but sets aside the two preceding alternatives. One substance may indeed connect itself with several states, but the former of the two alternatives implies that Brahman itself constitutes the essential nature of non-sentient matter, and thus there is no escape from the objections already stated under Sūtra 27. Let then the second alternative be adopted according to which Brahma-hood (brahmatva) constitutes a genus inhering in Brahman as well as in non-sentient matter, just as fire constitutes the common genus for light and luminous bodies.</description>

      <description>As it is desired; on account of there being no contradiction of either. The time when good and evil deeds are left behind thus having been determined on the basis of the reason of the thing, the several words of the passages must be construed as it is desired, i.e. so as not to contradict either, i.e. either the declaration of scripture or the reason of the thing. Thus in the text of the Kaushītakins the later clause, &amp;lsquo;he shakes off his good and evil deeds,&amp;rsquo; must be taken as coming before the earlier passage &amp;lsquo;having entered on that path of the gods.</description>

In the meditation on prāṇa, according to the Vājasaneyins and the Cḥāndogas, there is a statement as to all food being allowed to him who knows the prāṇa. &amp;lsquo;By him there is nothing eaten that is not food&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. VI, 1, 14; and so on). A doubt here arises whether this permission of all food is valid for him who possesses the knowledge of prāṇa, in all circumstances, or only in the case of life being in danger.</description>

Hereby, i.e. by the whole array of arguments set forth in the four pādas of the first adhyāya; all those particular passages of the Vedānta-texts which give instruction as to the cause of the world, are explained as meaning to set forth a Brahman all-wise, all-powerful, different in nature from all beings intelligent and non-intelligent.

      <description>And on account of the defects of his view also. On his view, i.e. on the view of him who holds the theory of the Pradhāna or something similar, the imperfections observed in ordinary things would attach themselves to the Pradhāna also, since it does not differ in nature from those things. The legitimate conclusion therefore is that Brahman only which differs in nature from all other things can be held to be the general cause.</description>

That even dream-cognitions are not devoid of real matter we have explained in the discussion of the different khyātis (above, p. 118).&amp;ndash;Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;lsquo;perception.</description>

      <description>But (the Self) is designated as that because it has that quality (viz. knowledge) for its essential quality; as in the case of the intelligent (prājña) Self. The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; discards the objection. Because that quality, viz. the quality of knowledge, is the essential quality, therefore the Self is, in the passages quoted, designated as knowledge. For knowledge constitutes the essential quality of the Self. Similarly, the intelligent highest Self is occasionally called &amp;lsquo;Bliss,&amp;rsquo; because bliss is its essential quality.</description>

      <description>And on account of denial. Texts such as &amp;lsquo;This is that great unborn Self, undecaying, undying&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 25), &amp;lsquo;By the old age of the body that does not age&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 1, 5), deny of Brahman the properties of non-sentient matter. From this it follows that the relation of the two can only be that of distinguishing attribute and thing distinguished, and hence of part and whole.</description>

      <description>There is meaning of the soul&amp;rsquo;s going (only) on the twofold hypothesis; for otherwise there is contradiction. It is only on the hypothesis of a part of the good and evil works being left behind at the time of the soul&amp;rsquo;s departure from the body, and another part later on, and the effacement of works thus taking place in a double way, that a sense can be found in the scriptural declaration of the soul proceeding on the path of the gods.</description>

      <description>And on account of non-sublation. The conclusion above arrived at is confirmed by the consideration that thus only those texts are not stultified
which enjoin, for those who know Brahman, purity in matters of food with a view to the origination of knowledge of Brahman. Cp.&amp;rsquo; when the food is pure the mind becomes pure&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. VII, 26, 2).</description>

      <description>On account of the impossibility (of qualification for the madhuvidyā, &amp;amp;c.) (Jaimini maintains the non-qualification (of gods, &amp;amp;c.). So far it has been proved that also the gods, and so on, are qualified for the knowledge of Brahman. But a further point here presents itself for consideration, viz. whether the gods are qualified or not to undertake those meditations of which they themselves are the objects. The Sūtra states as a pūrvapaksha view held by Jaimini, that they are not so qualified, for the reason that there are no other Ādityas, Vasus, and so on, who could be meditated on by the Ādityas and Vasus themselves; and that moreover for the Ādityas and Vasus the qualities and position of those classes of deities cannot be objects of desire, considering that they possess them already.</description>

      <description>And (the divinity is) endowed with all powers, because that is seen. The highest divinity which is different in nature from all other things is endowed with all powers; for scriptural texts show it to be such, &amp;lsquo;His high power is revealed as manifold, as essential, and so his knowledge, force, and action&amp;rsquo; (Śvet. Up. VI, 8). In the same way another text first declares the highest divinity to differ in nature from everything else, &amp;lsquo;Free from sin, from old age, from death and grief, from hunger and thirst&amp;rsquo;,and then goes on to represent it as endowed with all powers, &amp;lsquo;realising all its wishes, realising all its intentions&amp;rsquo;,&amp;amp;c.</description>

      <description>And on account of its being unproved in every way. Here now come forward the Mādhyamikas who teach that there is nothing but a universal Void. This theory of a universal Nothing is the real purport of Sugata&amp;rsquo;s doctrine; the theories of the momentariness of all existence, &amp;amp;c., which imply the acknowledgment of the reality of things, were set forth by him merely as suiting the limited intellectual capacities of his pupils.</description>

      <description>And there is no objection, since (the quality of knowledge) exists wherever the Self is; this being observed. Since knowledge is an attribute which is met with wherever a Self is, there is no objection to the Self being designated by that attribute. Similarly we observe that special kinds of cows, as e.g. hornless ones, are designated by the term &amp;lsquo;cow,&amp;rsquo; since the quality of possessing the generic character of cows is met with everywhere in connexion with the essential character of such animals with mutilated horns; since in fact that quality contributes to define their essential character.</description>

      <description>(There is something) higher than that; on account of the designations of bridge, measure, connexion, and difference. The Sūtras now proceed to refute an erroneous view based on some fallacious arguments, viz. that there is a being higher even than the highest Brahman, the supreme cause, material as well as operative, of the entire world&amp;ndash;a refutation which will confirm the view of Brahman being free from all imperfections and a treasure as it were of countless transcendentally exalted qualities.</description>

      <description>(That assumption) is justified; on account of the perception of things which are marks of that; as in ordinary experience. The assumption of all the works perishing at the time of &amp;lsquo;departure&amp;rsquo; involves no contradiction; since we perceive, in the sacred texts, matters which are marks of connexion with a body even on the part of the soul which has divested itself of all its works and become manifest in its true nature.</description>

      <description>This is said in Smr̥ti also. That for those as well who know Brahman, as for others, the eating of food of any kind is lawful only in case of extreme need, Smr̥ti also declares, &amp;lsquo;He who being in danger of his life eats food from anywhere is stained by sin no more than the lotus leaf by water.&amp;rsquo;</description>

      <description>And on account of (meditating on the part of the gods) being in the Light. &amp;lsquo;Him the devas meditate upon as the light of lights, as
immortal time&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 16). This text declares that the meditation of the gods has for its object the Light, i.e. the highest Brahman. Now this express declaration as to the gods being meditating devotees with regard to meditations on Brahman which are common to men and gods, implies a denial of the gods being qualified for meditations on other objects.</description>

      <description>Not, on account of the absence of organs; this has been explained (before). Although the one Brahman is different from all other beings and endowed with all powers, we yet infer from the text &amp;lsquo;Of him there is known no effect and no instrument,&amp;rsquo; that as it is destitute of instruments it cannot produce any effect.&amp;ndash;To this objection an answer has already been given in II, 1, 27; 28, &amp;lsquo;on account of its being founded on the word,&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;for there are manifold (powers).</description>

      <description>Not so, on account of the impossibility in one. The Bauddhas have been refuted. As now the Jainas also hold the view of the world originating from atoms and similar views, their theory is reviewed next.&amp;ndash;The Jainas hold that the world comprises souls (jīva), and non-souls (ajīva), and that there is no Lord. The world further comprises six substances (dravya), viz. souls (jīva), merit (dharma), demerit (adharma), bodies (pudgala), time (kāla), and space (ākāśa).</description>

      <description>Since there may be manifestation of that which exists; as in the case of virile power and so on. The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; is meant to set the raised objection aside. The case may be that while consciousness is present also in deep sleep, and so on, it is manifested in the waking state only; whence there would be no objection to viewing consciousness as an essential attribute of the Self. &amp;lsquo;As in the case of virile power and the like.</description>

      <description>But on account of resemblance. The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; sets aside the pūrvapaksha. There is no truth in the assertion that from the designation of the Highest as a biidge (or bank) it follows that there is something beyond the Highest. For Brahman in that text is not called a bank with regard to something to be reached thereby; since the additional clause &amp;lsquo;for the non-confounding of these worlds&amp;rsquo; declares that it is compared to a bridge or bank in so far as it binds to itself (setu being derived from śi, to bind) the whole aggregate of sentient and non-sentient things without any confusion.</description>

      <description>Of those who have a certain office there is subsistence (of their works) as long as the office lasts. We do not maintain that all those who have reached true knowledge divest themselves at the time of death of all their good and evil works; we limit our view to those who immediately after death attain to moving on the path, the first stage of which is light. Persons like Vasishṭḥa, on the other hand, who are entrusted with certain offices, do not immediately after death attain to moving on the path beginning with light, since the duties undertaken by them are not completely accomplished.</description>

The above conclusion is further confirmed by a scriptural passage prohibiting licence of conduct on the part of any one.

      <description>(Brahman is) not (the cause); on account of (the world) having the nature of what depends on a motive. Although the Lord, who before creation is alone, is endowed with all kinds of powers since he differs in nature
from all other beings, and hence is by himself capable of creating the world; we all the same cannot ascribe to him actual causality with regard to the world; for this manifold world displays the nature of a thing depending on a motive, and the Lord has no motive to urge him to creation.</description>

      <description>There would result permanent consciousness or non-consciousness, or else limitative restriction to either. On the other view, i.e. on the view of the Self being omnipresent and mere knowledge, it would follow either that consciousness and also non-consciousness would permanently take place together everywhere; or else that there would be definite permanent restriction to either of the two, i.e. either permanent consciousness or permanent non-consciousness.&amp;ndash;If the omnipresent Self, consisting of mere knowledge only, were the cause of all that actual consciousness and non-consciousness on the part of Selfs which takes place in the world, it might be conceived either as the cause of both&amp;ndash;i.</description>

      <description>It subserves the purpose of thought; as in the case of the feet. Where the texts speak of Brahman as having four quarters, and sixteen parts, or say that &amp;lsquo;one quarter of him are all these beings&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. III, 12, 6), they do so for the purpose of thought, i.e. meditation, only. For as texts such as &amp;rsquo;the Truth, knowledge, infinite is Brahman&amp;rsquo; teach Brahman, the cause of the world, to be unlimited, it cannot in itself be subject to measure.</description>

      <description>There is no restriction (since) all (have to go on that path). (Thus) there is non-contradiction of sacred text and Smr̥ti. The question here is whether Brahman is to be reached on the path of the gods by those only who take their stand on those meditations which, like the Upakośala-vidyā, describe that path, or by all who practise any of the meditations on Brahman. The Pūrvapakshin holds the former view, since there is no proof to show that in other vidyās the going on that path is not mentioned, and since those other vidyās-such as the texts &amp;lsquo;and those who in the forest meditate on faith and austerities,&amp;lsquo;and&amp;rsquo; those who in the forest worship faith, the True&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ.</description>

The doubt now arises whether those works are to be performed by him also who merely wishes to fulfil the duties of his āśrama, without aiming at final Release, or not. They are not, the Pūrvapakshin holds, for that things auxiliary to knowledge should stand in subordinate relation to a certain state of life would imply the contradiction of permanent and non-permanent obligation.</description>

      <description>(That) grief of him (arose), this is intimated by his (Jānaśruti&amp;rsquo;s) resorting to him (Raikva) on hearing a disrespectful speech about himself. From what the text says about Jānaśruti Pautrāyaṇa having been taunted by a flamingo for his want of knowledge of Brahman, and having thereupon resorted to Raikva, who possessed the knowledge of Brahman, it appears that sorrow (śuc) had taken possession of him; and it is with a view to this that Raikva addresses him as Śūdra.</description>

      <description>But (it is) mere sport, as in ordinary life. The motive which prompts Brahman&amp;ndash;all whose wishes are fulfilled and who is perfect in himself&amp;ndash;to the creation of a world comprising all kinds of sentient and non-sentient beings dependent on his volition, is nothing else but sport, play. We see in ordinary life how some great king, ruling this earth with its seven dvīpas, and possessing perfect strength, valour, and so on, has a game at balls, or the like, from no other motive than to amuse himself; hence there is no objection to the view that sport only is the motive prompting Brahman to the creation, sustentation, and destruction of this world which is easily fashioned by his mere will.</description>

      <description>And likewise non-entireness of the Self. On your view there would likewise follow non-entireness of the Self. For your opinion is that souls abide in numberless places, each soul having the same size as the body which it animates. When, therefore, the soul previously abiding in the body of an elephant or the like has to enter into a body of smaller size, e. g. that of an ant, it would follow that as the soul then occupies less space, it would not remain entire, but would become incomplete.</description>

      <description>(The soul is) an agent, on account of Scripture (thus) having a purport. It has been shown that the individual Self is a knowing subject and atomic. Now the question arises whether that Self is an agent or, being itself non-active, erroneously ascribes to itself the activity of the non-sentient guṇas. The primā facie answer is that the individual Self is not an agent, since the sacred texts concerned with the Self declare that the Self does not act, while the guṇas do act.</description>

      <description>Owing to difference of place, as in the case of light, and so on. Owing to the difference of limiting adjuncts constituted by special places, such as speech, and so on, Brahman in so far as connected with these adjuncts may be viewed as having measure; just as light and the like although spread everywhere may be viewed as limited, owing to its connexion with different places&amp;ndash;windows, jars, and so on.</description>

There being equality (of the Brahman to be meditated on) and (those conceptions) existing (in Brahman); as in the case of what belongs to the upasad. This has been explained.

      <description>And on account of co-operativeness. These works are to be performed also on account of their being co-operative towards knowledge in so far, namely, as they give rise to the desire of knowledge; and their thus being enjoined for a double purpose does not imply contradiction any more than the double injunctions of the Agnihotra, which one text connects with the life of the sacrificer and another text with his desire to reach the heavenly world.</description>

      <description>And on account of (Jānaśruti ) kshattriya-hood being understood. The first section of the vidyā tells us that Jānaśruti bestowed much wealth and food; later on he is represented as sending his door-keeper on an errand; and in the end, as bestowing on Raikva many villages&amp;ndash;which shows him to be a territorial lord. All these circumstances suggest Jānaśruti&amp;rsquo;s being a Kshattriya, and hence not a member of the lowest caste.</description>

      <description>Not inequality and cruelty, on account of there being regard; for so (Scripture) declares. It must indeed be admitted that the Lord, who differs in nature from all other beings, intelligent and non-intelligent,
and hence possesses powers unfathomable by thought, is capable of creating this manifold world, although before creation he is one only and without parts. But the assumption of his having actually created the world would lay him open to the charge of partiality, in so far as the world contains beings of high, middle, and low station&amp;ndash;gods, men, animals, immovable beings; and to that of cruelty, in so far as he would be instrumental in making his creatures experience pain of the most dreadful kind.</description>

      <description>Nor also is there non-contradiction from paryāya; on account of change, and so on. Nor is the difficulty to be evaded by the assumption of the soul assuming a different condition through contraction or dilatation. For this would imply that the soul is subject
to change, and all the imperfections springing from it, viz. non-permanence, and so on, and hence would not be superior to non-sentient things such as jars and the like.</description>

      <description>On account of taking and the declaration as to its moving about. The text beginning &amp;lsquo;And as a great king,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c., declares that &amp;rsquo;the Self taking the pranas moves about in its own body,
according to its pleasure&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. II, 1, 18), i.e. it teaches that the Self is active in taking to itself the prāṇas and moving about in the body.</description>

Nor is there any truth in the assertion that, because texts such as &amp;lsquo;he is the bridge of the Immortal&amp;rsquo; intimate a distinction between that which causes to reach and the object reached, there must be something to be reached different from that which causes to reach; for the highest Self may be viewed as being itself a means towards itself being reached; cp. &amp;lsquo;The Self cannot be reached by the Veda, and so on; he whom the Self chooses by him the Self can be gained&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ.</description>

      <description>So much; on account of reflection. Only so much, i.e. only those qualities which have to be included in all meditations on Brahman, without which the essential special nature of Brahman cannot be conceived, i.e. bliss, knowledge, and so on, characterised by absence of grossness and the like. Other qualities, such as doing all works and the like, although indeed following their substrate, are explicitly to be meditated on in special meditations only.</description>

      <description>In any case they are the same, on account of twofold inferential signs. There is no radical difference of works; but in any case, i.e. whether they be viewed as duties incumbent on the āśrama or as auxiliary to knowledge, sacrifices and other works are one and the same. For Scripture, in enjoining them in both these aspects, makes use of the same terms, so that we recognise the same acts, and there is no means of proof to establish difference of works.</description>

      <description>On account of the inferential sign further on, together with Caitraratha. The kshattriya-hood of Jānaśruti is further to be accepted on account of the Kshattriya Abhipratārin Caitraratha, who is mentioned further on in this very same Saṁvargavidyā which Raikva imparts to Jānaśruti.&amp;ndash;But why?&amp;ndash;As follows. The section beginning &amp;lsquo;Once a Brahmacārin
begged of Saunaka Kāpeya and Abhipratārin Kākshaseni while being waited on at their meal,&amp;rsquo; and ending &amp;rsquo;thus do we, O Brahmacārin, meditate on that being,&amp;rsquo; shows Kāpeya, Abhipratārin, and the Brahmacārin to be connected with the Saṁvarga-vidyā.</description>

      <description>If it be said &amp;rsquo;not so, on account of non-distinction of deeds&amp;rsquo;; we say, &amp;rsquo;not so, on account of beginninglessness&amp;rsquo;; this is reasonable, and it is also observed. But before creation the individual souls do not exist; since Scripture teaches non-distinction &amp;lsquo;Being only this was in the beginning.&amp;rsquo; And as then the souls do not exist, no karman can exist, and it cannot therefore be said that the inequality of creation depends on karman.</description>

      <description>And on account of the endurance of the final (size), and the (resulting) permanency of both; there is no difference. The final size of the soul, i.e. the size it has in the state of Release, is enduring since the soul does not subsequently pass into another body; and both, i.e. the soul in the state of Release and the size of that soul, are permanent (nitya). From this it follows that that ultimate size is the true essential size of the soul and also belongs to it previously to Release.</description>

      <description>And on account of the designation (of the Self as the agent) in actions. If not so, there would be change of grammatical expression. Because in the text &amp;lsquo;Knowledge performs the sacrifice, it performs all works&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 5) the Self is designated as the agent in all worldly and Vedic works, for this reason also the Self must be held to be an agent. And should it be said that the word &amp;lsquo;knowledge&amp;rsquo; in that text denotes not the Self, but the internal organ or buddhi, we point out that in that case there would be a change of grammatical expression, that is to say, as the buddhi is the instrument of action, the text would exhibit the instrumental case instead of the nominative case &amp;lsquo;by knowledge, and so on&amp;rsquo; (vijñānena instead of vijñānam).</description>

      <description>And Scripture also declares (knowledge) not to be overpowered. Texts such as &amp;lsquo;By works of sacred duty he drives away evil&amp;rsquo; declare that sacrifices and similar works have the effect of knowledge &amp;rsquo;not being overpowered,&amp;rsquo; i.e. of the origination of knowledge not being obstructed by evil works. Sacrifices and similar works being performed day after day have the effect of purifying the mind, and owing to this, knowledge arises in the mind with ever increasing brightness.</description>

      <description>On account of the reference to ceremonial purifications, and on account of the declaration of their absence. In sections the purport of which is to give instruction about Brahman the ceremony of initiation is referred to, &amp;lsquo;I will initiate you; he initiated him&amp;rsquo; (Kh. Up. IV, 4).
And at the same time the absence of such ceremonies in the case of Śūdras is stated: &amp;lsquo;In the Śūdra there is not any sin, and he is not fit for any ceremony&amp;rsquo; (Manu X, 126); and &amp;lsquo;The fourth caste is once born, and not fit for any ceremony&amp;rsquo; (Manu X, 4).</description>

      <description>And because all the attributes are proved (to be present in Brahman). As all those attributes required to constitute causality which have been or will be shown to be absent in the Pradhāna, the atoms, and so on, can be shown to be present in Brahman, it remains a settled conclusion that Brahman only is the cause of the world. Here terminates the adhikaraṇa of &amp;rsquo;that which has the nature of depending on a motive.</description>

      <description>(The system) of the Lord (must be disregarded), on account of inappropriateness. So far it has been shown that the doctrines of Kapila, Kaṇāda, Sugata, and the Arhat must be disregarded by men desirous of final beatitude; for those doctrines are all alike untenable and foreign to the Veda. The Sūtras now declare that, for the same reasons, the doctrine of Paśupati also has to be disregarded. The adherents of this view belong to four different classes&amp;ndash;Kāpālas, Kālāmukhas, Pāśupatas, and Śaivas.</description>

      <description>(There would be) absence of definite rule, as in the case of consciousness. The Sūtra points out a difficulty which arises on the view of the Self not being an agent. Sūtra 32 has declared that if the Self were all-pervading it would follow that there would be no definite determination with regard to consciousness. Similarly, if the Self were not an agent but all activity belonged to Prakr̥ti it would follow that as Prakr̥ti is a common possession of all souls, all actions would result in enjoyment (experience) on the part of all souls, or else on the part of none; for as each Self is held to be omnipresent, they are all of them in equal proximity to all parts of the Pradhāna.</description>

That omnipresence which is possessed &amp;lsquo;by that,&amp;rsquo; i.e. by Brahman, and which is known &amp;lsquo;from declarations of extent,&amp;rsquo; and so on, i.e. from texts which declare Brahman to be all-pervading, is also known from texts such as &amp;lsquo;higher than that there is nothing.&amp;rsquo; Declarations of extent are e.g. the following: &amp;lsquo;By this Person this whole Universe is filled&amp;rsquo;</description>

      <description>There is interchange (of ideas), for the texts distinguish; as in other cases. There is no difference of vidyā because both questions and answers have one subject-matter, and because the one word that possesses enjoining power proves the connexion of the two sections. Both questions have for their topic Brahman viewed as the inner Self of all; and in the second question the word &amp;rsquo;eva&amp;rsquo; (&amp;lsquo;just,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;very&amp;rsquo;) in &amp;lsquo;Tell me just that Brahman,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.</description>

      <description>Also in the case of those outside, as this is seen. It has been declared that the members of the four āśramas have a claim to the knowledge of Brahman, and that the duties connected with each āśrarna promote knowledge. A doubt now arises whether those men also who, on account of poverty and so on, stand outside the āśramas are qualified for the knowledge of Brahman, or rtot.&amp;ndash;They are not, the Pūrvapakshin holds, since such knowledge is to be attained in a way dependent on the special duties of each āśrama; while those who do not belong to an āśrama are not concerned with āśrama duties.</description>

      <description>And on account of the procedure, on the ascertainment of the non-being of that. That a Śūdra is not qualified for knowledge of Brahman appears from that fact also that as soon as Gautama has convinced himself that Jābāla, who wishes to become his pupil, is not a Śūdra, he proceeds to teach him the knowledge of Brahman.</description>

      <description>And on account of the impossibility of rulership. Those who stand outside the Veda arrive through inference at the conclusion that the Lord is a mere operative cause. This being so, they must prove the Lord&amp;rsquo;s being the ruler (of the material cause) on the basis of observation. But it is impossible to prove that the Lord is the ruler of the Pradhāna in the same way as the potter e.</description>

      <description>On account of the inversion of power. If the internal organ were the agent, then&amp;ndash;since it is
impossible that a being other than the agent should be the enjoyer of the fruit of the action&amp;ndash;the power of enjoyment also would belong to the internal organ, and would consequently have to be denied of the Self. But if this were so, there would be no longer any proof for the existence of the Self; for they expressly teach that &amp;rsquo;the person (i.</description>

      <description>From thence the reward; on account of possibility. It has been shown, for the purpose of giving rise to a desire for devout meditation, that the soul in all its states is imperfect, while the Supreme Person to be reached by it is free from imperfections, the owner of blessed qualities and higher than everything else. Being about to investigate the nature of meditation, the Sūtrakāra now declares that the meditating devotee receives the reward of meditation, i.</description>

which was introduced in the clause &amp;rsquo;that divinity thought,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.&amp;ndash;is intimated by all the following sections of that chapter. This is proved by the fact that the attributes&amp;ndash;&amp;rsquo;that which truly is&amp;rsquo; and so on&amp;ndash;which were mentioned in the first section and confirmed in the subsequent ones, are finally summed up in the statement, &amp;lsquo;in that all this has its Self, that is the True, that is the Self.</description>

      <description>Smr̥ti also states this. Smr̥ti also declares that men not belonging to an āśrama grow in knowledge through prayer and the like. &amp;lsquo;Through prayer also a Brāhmaṇa may become perfect. May he perform other works or not, one who befriends all creatures is called a Brāhmaṇa&amp;rsquo; (Manu Smr̥. II, 17).</description>

      <description>And on account of the prohibition of hearing, studying, and performance of (Vedic) matter. The Śūdra is specially forbidden to hear and study the Veda and to perform the things enjoined in it. &amp;lsquo;For a Śūdra is like a cemetery, therefore the Veda must not be read in the vicinity of a Śūdra;&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Therefore the Śūdra is like a beast, unfit for sacrifices.&amp;rsquo; And he who does not hear the Veda recited cannot learn it so as to understand and perform what the Veda enjoins.</description>

      <description>If you say, as in the case of the organs; we deny this, on account of enjoyment and so on. It may possibly be said that, in the same way as the enjoying (individual) soul, although in itself without a body, is seen to rule the sense-organs, the body, and so on, the great Lord also, although without a body, may rule the Pradhāna. But this analogy cannot be allowed &amp;lsquo;on account of enjoyment,&amp;rsquo; and so on.</description>

      <description>And on account of the absence of samādhi. If the internal organ were the agent, it would be such even in that final state of meditation, called samādhi, which is the instrument of Release. But that state consists therein that the meditating being realises its difference from Prakr̥ti, and this is a conception which Prakr̥ti itself (of which the internal organ is only a modification) cannot form. The Self alone, therefore, is the agent.</description>

wealth&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 24); and &amp;lsquo;For he alone causes delight&amp;rsquo; (Taitt. Up. II, 7).&amp;ndash;Next a primā facie view is stated.</description>

      <description>Wishes and the rest, here and there; (as is known from the abode, and so on). We read in the Cḥāndogya (VIII, I, 1), &amp;lsquo;There is that city of Brahman, and in it the palace, the small lotus, and in it that small ether,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.; and in the Vājasaneyaka, &amp;lsquo;He is that great unborn Self who consists of knowledge,&amp;rsquo; and so on.

      <description>And there is the promotion (of knowledge) through special acts (of duty). The above conclusion is founded not only on Reasoning and Smr̥ti; but Scripture even directly states that knowledge is benefited by practices not exclusively prescribed for the āśramas, &amp;lsquo;By penance, abstinence, faith, and knowledge he is to seek the Self (Pr. Up. I, 10).</description>

      <description>And on account of Smr̥ti. Smr̥ti also declares this prohibition of hearing, and so on. &amp;lsquo;The ears of him who hears the Veda are to be filled with molten lead and lac; if he pronounces it his tongue is to be slit; if he preserves it his body is to be cut through.&amp;rsquo; And &amp;lsquo;He is not to teach him sacred duties or vows.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;It is thus a settled matter that the Śūdras are not qualified for meditations on Brahman.</description>

      <description>And as the carpenter, in both ways. The Self, although always provided with the instruments of action, such as the organ of speech, and so on, acts when it wishes to do so, and does not act when it does not wish to do so. Just as a carpenter, although having his axe and other implements ready at hand, works or does not work just as he pleases. If the internal organ, on the contrary, were essentially active, it would constantly be acting, since as a non-intelligent being it could not be influenced by particular reasons for action, such as the desire for enjoyment.</description>

      <description>For the same reasons Jaimini (thinks it to be) religious action. For the same reasons, viz. possibility and scriptural declaration, the teacher Jaimini thinks that religious works, viz. sacrifices, gifts, offerings, and meditation, of themselves bring about their rewards. For we observe that in ordinary life actions such as ploughing and the like, and charitable gifts and so on, bring about their own reward, directly or indirectly. And although Vedic works do not bring about their rewards immediately, they may do so mediately, viz.</description>

      <description>On account of emphasis there is non-omission. Attributes, such as having the power of immediately realising one&amp;rsquo;s purposes, and so on, which are not by other means known to constitute attributes of Brahman, and are in the two texts under discussion, as well as in other texts, emphatically declared to be attributes of Brahman, as constituting the object of meditations undertaken with a view to final release, cannot be omitted from those meditations, but must be comprised within them.</description>

      <description>But better than that is the other also on account of an inferential mark. Better than to be outside the āśramas is the condition of standing within an āśrama. The latter state may be due to misfortune; but he who can should be within an āśrama, which state is the more holy and beneficial one. This follows from inference only, i.e. Smr̥ti; for Smr̥ti says, &amp;lsquo;A Brāhmaṇa is to remain outside the āśramas not even for one day.</description>

      <description>On account of the trembling. In the part of the Kaṭḥa-Upanishad which intervenes between the passage &amp;lsquo;The Person of the size of a thumb
stands in the middle of the Self (II, 4, 12), and the passage &amp;lsquo;The Person of the size of a thumb, the inner Self&amp;rsquo; (II, 6, 17), we meet with the text &amp;lsquo;whatever there is, the whole world, when gone forth, trembles in its breath. A great terror, a raised thunderbolt; those who knew it became immortal.</description>

      <description>On account of the impossibility of origination. The Sūtras now proceed to refute a further doubt, viz.
that the Pañcarātra tantra&amp;ndash;which sets forth the means of attaining supreme beatitude, as declared by the Lord (Bhagavat)&amp;ndash;may also be destitute of authority, in so far, namely, as belonging to the same class as the tantras of Kapila and others. The above Sūtra raises the doubt.
The theory of the Bhāgavatas is that from Vāsudeva, who is the highest Brahman and the highest cause, there originates the individual soul called Sankarshaṇa; from Sankarshaṇa the internal organ called Pradyumna; and from Pradyumna the principle of egoity called Aniruddha.</description>

      <description>But from the highest, this being declared by Scripture. Is the activity of the individual soul independent (free), or does it depend on the highest Self? It is free; for if it were dependent on the highest Self, the whole body of scriptural injunctions and prohibitions would be unmeaning. For commandments can be addressed to such
agents only as are capable of entering on action or refraining from action, according to their own thought and will.</description>

      <description>But the former, Bādarāyaṇa (thinks), on account of the designation (of deities) as the cause. The reverend Bādarāyaṇa maintains the previously declared awarding of rewards by the Supreme Person since the scriptural texts referring to the different sacrifices declare that the deities only, Agni, Vāyu, and so on, who are propitiated by the sacrifices&amp;ndash;which are nothing else but means to propitiate deities&amp;ndash;are the cause of the rewards attached to the sacrifices.</description>

      <description>In the case of him who has approached (Brahman); just on that account, this being declared by the text. When the soul, released from all bonds and manifesting itself in its true nature, has approached, i.e. attained to Brahman; then just on that account, i.e. on account of such approach, the text declares it to possess the power of moving about at will in all worlds. &amp;lsquo;Having approached the highest light he manifests himself in his true form.</description>

      <description>But of him who has become that there is no becoming not that, according to Jaimini also, on account of (Scripture) restraining from the absence of the forms of that. The doubt here arises whether those also who have fallen from the state of life of a Naishṭḥika, Vaikhānasa or Pārivrājaka are qualified for the knowledge of Brahman or not.&amp;ndash;They are so, since in their case, no less than in that of widowers and the like, the growth of knowledge may be assisted by charity and other practices not confined to āśramas.</description>

      <description>On account of light being seen (declared in the text). Between the two texts referring to the Person of the size of a thumb, there is a text declaring that to that Person there belongs light that obscures all other light, and is the cause and assistance of all other light; and such light is characteristic of Brahman only. &amp;lsquo;The sun does not shine there, nor the moon and the stars, nor these lightnings, and much less this fire.</description>

      <description>And there is not (origination) of the instrument from the agent. &amp;lsquo;The internal organ called Pradyumna originates from Sankarshaṇa,&amp;rsquo; i. e. the internal organ originates from the individual soul which is the agent. But this is inadmissible, since the text &amp;lsquo;from him there is produced breath, mind, and all sense-organs&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3) declares that the mind also springs from none else but the highest Brahman. As the Bhāgavata doctrine thus teaches things opposed to Scripture, its authoritativeness cannot be admitted.</description>

      <description>But with a view to the efforts made (the Lord makes the soul act) on account of the (thus resulting) non-meaninglessness of injunctions and prohibitions and the rest. The inwardly ruling highest Self promotes action in so far as it regards in the case of any action the volitional effort made by the individual soul, and then aids that effort by granting its favour or permission (anumati); action is not possible without permission on the part of the highest Self.</description>

      <description>There is non-restriction of determination, because this is seen; for there is a separate fruit, viz. non-obstruction. There are certain meditations connected with elements of sacrificial actions; as e.g. &amp;lsquo;Let a man meditate on the syllable Om as udgītha.&amp;rsquo; These meditations are subordinate elements of the sacrificial acts with which they connect themselves through the udgītha and so on, in the same way as the quality of being made of parṇa wood connects itself with the sacrifice through the ladle (made of parṇa wood), and are to be undertaken on that very account.</description>

      <description>Nor the (expiatory performance) described in the chapter treating of qualification; that being impossible on account of the Smr̥ti referring to such lapse. Those expiatory performances which are described in the chapter treating of qualification (Pū. Mī. Sū. VI) are not possible in the case of him who has lapsed from the condition of a Naishṭḥika; since such expiations do not apply to him, as is shown by a Smr̥ti text referring to such lapse, viz.</description>

      <description>The ether, on account of the designation of something different, and so on. We read in the Cḥāndogya. &amp;lsquo;The ether is the evolver of forms and names. That within which these forms and names are (or &amp;ldquo;that which is within&amp;ndash;or without&amp;ndash;these forms and names&amp;rdquo;) is Brahman, the Immortal, the Self&amp;rsquo; (VIII, 14).

The &amp;lsquo;or&amp;rsquo; sets aside the view previously maintained. By &amp;rsquo;that which is knowledge and so on&amp;rsquo; 1 we have to understand the highest Brahman. If Sankarshaṇa, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha are of the nature of the highest Brahman, then truly there can be no objection to a body of doctrine</description>

      <description>(The soul is) a part, on account of the declarations of difference and otherwise; some also record (that Brahman is of) the nature of slaves, fishermen, and so on.
The Sūtras have declared that the individual soul is an agent, and as such dependent on the highest Person. The following question now arises&amp;ndash;Is the individual soul absolutely different from Brahman? or is it nothing else than Brahman itself in so far as under the influence of error?</description>

      <description>Just as in the case of the offerings. This has been explained. In the daharavidyā (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 1 ff.) the text, &amp;rsquo;those who depart having known here the Self, and those true desires,&amp;rsquo; declares at first a meditation on the small ether, i.e. the highest Self, and separately therefrom a meditation on its qualities, viz. true desires, and so on. The doubt here arises whether, in the meditation on those qualities, the meditation on the highest Self&amp;ndash;as that to which the qualities belong&amp;ndash;is to be repeated or not.</description>

      <description>A minor one, thus some; (and hence they hold) the existence (of expiation), as in the case of eating. This has been explained. Some teachers are of opinion that even on the part of Naishṭḥikas and the rest the lapse from chastity constitutes only a minor offence which can be atoned for by expiatory observances; in the same way as in the case of the eating of forbidden food the same prāyaścitta may be used by the ordinary Brahmacārin and by Naishṭḥikas and the rest.</description>

      <description>On account of difference in deep sleep and departing. We have to supply &amp;lsquo;on account of designation&amp;rsquo; from the preceding Sūtra. Because the text designates the highest Self as something different from the individual Self in the state of deep sleep as well as at the time of departure, the highest Self is thus different. For the Vājasaneyaka, after having introduced the individual Self in the passage &amp;lsquo;Who is that Self?</description>

      <description>And on account of contradiction. The origination of the jīva is, moreover, distinctly controverted in the books of the Bhāgavatas also. Thus in the Parama-saṁhitā &amp;lsquo;The nature of Prakr̥ti consists therein that she is non-sentient, for the sake of another, eternal, ever-changing, comprising within herself the three guṇas. and constituting the sphere of action and experience for all agents. With her the soul (purusha) is connected in the way of inseparable association; that soul is known to be truly without beginning and without end.</description>

III, 12, 6)&amp;ndash;on account of this mantra also the soul must be held to be a part of Brahman. For the word &amp;lsquo;foot&amp;rsquo; denotes a part. As the individual souls are many the mantra uses the plural form &amp;lsquo;all beings.&amp;rsquo; In the Sūtra (42) the word &amp;lsquo;part&amp;rsquo; is in the singular, with a view to denote the whole class.</description>

      <description>On account of the plurality of indicatory marks; for that (proof) is stronger. This also is declared (in the Pūrva Mīmāmsā). The Taittirīyaka contains another daharavidyā, &amp;lsquo;The thousand-headed god, the all-eyed one,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Mahānār. Up. XI). Here the doubt arises whether this vidyā, as being one with the previously introduced vidyā, states qualities to be included in the meditation enjoined in that vidyā, or qualities to be included in the meditations on the highest Self as enjoined in all the Vedānta-texts.</description>

      <description>But in either case (such men) stand outside; on account of Smr̥ti and custom. Whether the point under discussion constitutes a minor or a major offence, in any case those who have lapsed stand outside the category of those qualified for the knowledge of Brahman. For Smr̥ti, i.e. the text quoted above, &amp;lsquo;I see no expiatory performance by which he, a slayer of Brahman as he is, could become pure again,&amp;rsquo; declares that expiations are powerless to restore purity.</description>

That embracing highest Self is further on designated by terms such as Lord, and so on. &amp;lsquo;He is the Lord of all, the master of all, the ruler of all.

      <description>Moreover it is so stated in Smr̥ti. Smr̥ti moreover declares the individual soul to be a part of the highest Person, &amp;lsquo;An eternal part of myself becomes
the individual soul (jīva) in the world of life&amp;rsquo; (Bha. Gī. XV, 7). For this reason also the soul must be held to be a part of Brahman.
But if the soul is a part of Brahman, all the imperfections of the soul are Brahman&amp;rsquo;s also!</description>

      <description>There is option with regard to what precedes (i.e. the altar made of bricks) on account of subject-matter, and hence there is action; as in the case of the mānasa cup. In the Vājasaneyaka, in the Agnirahasya chapter, there are references to certain altars built of mind, &amp;lsquo;built of mind, built of speech,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. The doubt here arises whether those structures of mind, and so on, which metaphorically are called fire-altars, should be considered as being of the nature of action, on account of their connexion with a performance which itself is of the nature of action; or merely of the nature of meditation, as being connected with an activity of the nature of meditation.</description>

      <description>But as in the case of light and so on. Not so is the highest. The &amp;lsquo;but&amp;rsquo; discards the objection. &amp;lsquo;Like light and so on.&amp;rsquo; The individual soul is a part of the highest Self; as the light issuing from a luminous thing such as fire or the sun is a part of that body; or as the generic characteristics of a cow or horse, and the white or black colour of things so coloured, are attributes and hence parts of the things in which those attributes inhere; or as the body is a part of an embodied being.</description>

      <description>And on account of the transfer. That the altar built of thought is an optional substitute for the altar built of bricks, and of the nature of an action, appears therefrom also that the clause &amp;lsquo;of these each one is as great as that previous one,&amp;rsquo; explicitly transfers to the altars of mind, and so on, the powers of the previous altar made of bricks. All those altars thus having equal effects there is choice between them.</description>

      <description>(They are) the priest&amp;rsquo;s work, Auḍulomi thinks; since for that he is engaged. The teacher Auḍulomi is of opinion that the meditation on the Udgītha and the like is the work of the priest, since it is he who is engaged for the purpose of performing that which gives rise to the fruit, i.e. of the entire sacrifice with all its subordinate parts. Injunctions referring to the performance of the sacrifices such as &amp;lsquo;he chooses the priests; he gives to the priests their fee&amp;rsquo; indicate that the entire sacrificial performance is the work of the priests, and that hence all activities comprised within it&amp;ndash;mental as well as bodily&amp;ndash;belong to the priests.</description>

      <description>And Smr̥ti texts declare this. That the world and Brahman stand to each other in the relation of part and whole, the former being like the light and the latter like the luminous body, or the former being like the power and the latter like that in which the power inheres, or the former being like the body and the latter like the soul; this Parāśara also and other Smr̥ti writers declare, &amp;lsquo;As the light of a fire which abides in one place only spreads all around, thus this whole world is the power (śakti) of the highest Brahman.</description>

      <description>But it is a meditation only, on account of assertion and what is seen. The altars built of mind, and so on, are not of the nature of action, but of meditation only, i.e. they belong to a performance which is of the nature of meditation only. For this is what the text asserts, viz. in the clauses &amp;rsquo;they are built of knowledge only,&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;by knowledge they are built for him who thus knows.</description>

      <description>There is injunction of other auxiliary means for him who is such, as in the case of injunction and so on; (the term mauna denoting) according to an alternative meaning a third something. &amp;lsquo;Therefore let a Brāhmaṇa after he has done with learning wish to stand by a childlike state; and after having done with the childlike state and learning (he is) a Muni&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. III, 5). A doubt arises whether this text enjoins Muni-hood in the same way as it enjoins learning and the childlike state, or merely refers to it as something already established.</description>

      <description>Permission and exclusion (result) from connexion with a body; as in the case of light and so on. Although all souls are essentially of the same nature in so far as they are parts of Brahman, knowing subjects and so on, the permissions and exclusions referred to are possible for the reason that each individual soul is joined to some
particular body, pure or impure, whether of a Brāhmaṇa or Kshattriya or Vaiśya or Śūdra, and so on.</description>

      <description>And on account of the greater strength of direct statement, and so on, there is no refutation. The weaker means of proof, constituted by so-called leading subject-matter, cannot refute what is established by three stronger means of proof&amp;ndash;direct statement, inferential mark, and syntactical connexion&amp;ndash;viz. that there is an independent purely mental performance, and that the altars made of mind are parts of the latter. The direct statement is contained in the following passage, &amp;lsquo;Those fire-altars indeed are built of knowledge,&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;which is further explained in the subsequent passage, &amp;lsquo;by knowledge alone these altars are built for him who knows this&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;the sense of which is: the structures of mind, and so on, are built in connexion with a performance which consists of knowledge (i.</description>

      <description>But on account of the existence (of knowledge) in all, there is winding up with the householder. As knowledge belongs to the members of all āśramas it belongs to the householder also, and for this reason the Upanishad winds up with the latter. This winding up therefore is meant to illustrate the duties (not of the householder only, but) of the members of all āśramas. Analogously in the text under discussion (Br̥.</description>

      <description>And on account of non-connectedness there is no confusion. Although the souls, as being parts of Brahman and so on, are of essentially the same character, they are actually separate, for each of them is of atomic size and resides in a separate body. For this reason there is no confusion or mixing up of the individual spheres of enjoyment and experience. The Sūtrakāra introduces this reference to an advantage of his own view of things, in order to intimate that the views of the soul being Brahman deluded or else Brahman affected by a limiting adjunct are on their part incapable of explaining how it is that the experiences of the individual Self and the highest Self, and of the several individual Selfs, are not mixed up.</description>

      <description>On account of connexions and the rest, as in the case of the separateness of other cognitions. And this is seen (elsewhere also); as declared (in the Pūrva Mīmāṁsā). That the text enjoins a meditative performance different from the actual performance of which the brick-altar is a constituent element, follows from the reasons proving separation, viz. the connexions. i.e. the things connected with the sacrifice, such as the Soma cups, the hymns, the recitations, and so on.</description>

      <description>On account of the others also being taught, in the same way as the condition of the Muni. The injunction, on him who has passed beyond all desire, of mauna preceded by pārivrājya (wandering about as a mendicant), is meant to illustrate the duties of all āśramas . For the duties of the other āśramas are taught by Scripture no less than those of the Muni (and the householder). Similarly it was shown above that in the text &amp;lsquo;There are three branches of sacred duty&amp;ndash;he who is founded on Brahman goes to immortality,&amp;rsquo; the term &amp;lsquo;founded on Brahman&amp;rsquo; applies equally to members of all āśramas .</description>

      <description>And it is a mere apparent argument. The argumentation by which it is sought to prove that that being whose nature is constituted by absolutely uniform light, i.e. intelligence, is differentiated by limiting adjuncts which presuppose an obscuration of that essential nature, is a mere apparent(fallacious) one. For, as we have shown before, obscuration of the light of that which is nothing but light means destruction of that light.&amp;ndash;If we accept as the reading of the Sūtra &amp;lsquo;ābhāśāḥ&amp;rsquo; (in plural) the meaning is that the various reasons set forth by the adherents of that doctrine are all of them fallacious.</description>

      <description>Not so, on account of this being observed on account of similarity also; as in the case of Death; for (the person in yonder orb) does not occupy the worlds (of Death). From a transfer or assimilation of this kind it does not necessarily follow that things of different operation are equal, and that hence those altars of mind, and so on, must connect themselves with an actual outward performance.</description>

      <description>On account of the non-determination of the adr̥shṭas. As the adr̥shṭas also which are the causes of the series of upādhis have for their substrate Brahman itself, there is no reason for their definite allotment(to definite individual souls), and hence again there is no definite separation of the spheres of experience. For the limiting adjuncts as well as the adr̥shṭas cannot by their connexion with Brahman split up Brahman itself which is essentially one.</description>

      <description>And by a subsequent (Brāhmaṇa) also the &amp;lsquo;being of such a kind&amp;rsquo; of the word (is proved). But the connexion is on account of plurality. The subsequent Brāhmaṇa (Śat. Br. X, 5, 4) also proves that the text treating of the altars made of mind, and so on, enjoins a meditation only. For that Brāhmaṇa (which begins &amp;lsquo;This brick-built fire-altar is this world; the waters are its enclosing-stones,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.) declares further on &amp;lsquo;whosoever knows this thus comes to be that whole Agni who is the space-filler,&amp;rsquo; and from this it appears that what is enjoined there is a meditation with a special result of its own.</description>

      <description>What belongs to this world, there being no obstruction at hand; as this is seen. Knowledge, as enjoined by Scripture, is twofold, having
for its fruit either exaltation within the sphere of the Saṁsāra, or final Release. With regard to the former the question arises whether it springs up only immediately subsequent to the good works which are the means to bring it about; or, indefinitely, either subsequent to such works or at some later time.</description>

For the same reason there can be no definite restriction in the case of purposes and so on which are the causes of the,different adr̥shṭas.

      <description>Some, on account of the existence of a Self within a body. In all meditations on the highest Self the nature of the meditating subject has to be ascertained no less than the nature of the object of meditation and of the mode of meditation.

      <description>Should it be said (that that is possible) owing to the difference of place; we deny this, on account of (all upādhis) being within (all places). Although Brahman is one only and not to be split by the several limiting adjuncts with which it is connected,
yet the separation of the spheres of enjoyment is not impossible since the places of Brahman which are connected with the upādhis are distinct.</description>

      <description>But this is not so, (but rather) difference; since it is of the being of that; as in the case of intuition. It is not true that the meditating subject must be conceived as having the ordinary characteristics of knowing, acting, &amp;amp;c.; it rather possesses those characteristic properties&amp;ndash;freedom from evil, and so on&amp;ndash;which distinguish the state of Release from the Saṁsāra state. At the time of meditation the Self of the devotee is of exactly the same nature as the released Self.</description>

      <description>But those (meditations) which are connected with members (of sacrifices) are not (restricted) to (particular) śākhās, but rather (belong) to all śākhās. There are certain meditations connected with certain constituent elements of sacrifices-as e.g. &amp;lsquo;Let a man meditate on the syllable Om (as) the Udgītha &amp;lsquo;(Kh. Up. I, 1, 1); &amp;lsquo;Let a man meditate on the fivefold Saman as the five worlds&amp;rsquo; (Kh. Up. II, 2, 1), &amp;amp;c. The question here arises whether those meditations are restricted to the members of those śākhās in whose texts they are mentioned; or to be connected with the Udgītha, and so on, in all śākhās.</description>

      <description>Or there is no contradiction as in the case of mantras and the rest. The &amp;lsquo;or&amp;rsquo; here has the sense of &amp;lsquo;and.&amp;rsquo; The &amp;lsquo;and the rest&amp;rsquo; comprises generic characteristics, qualities, number, similarity, order of succession, substances, and actions. As there is nothing contrary to reason in mantras and the rest, although mentioned in the text of one śākhā only, finding, on the basis of such means of proof as direct statement, and so on, their application in all śākhās, since the sacrifice to which they belong is one and the same in all śākhās; so there is likewise no contradiction in the meditations under discussion being undertaken by members of all śākhās.</description>

      <description>There is pre-eminence of plenitude, as in the case of the sacrifice; for thus Scripture shows. The sacred text (Cḥ. Up. V, 12 ff.) enjoins a meditation on Vaiśvānara, the object of which is the highest Self, as having for its body the entire threefold world, and for its limbs the heavenly world, the sun, the wind, and so on. The doubt here arises whether separate meditations have to be performed on the highest Being in its separate aspects, or in its aggregate as well as in its distributed aspect, or in its aggregate aspect only.</description>

      <description>(The meditations are) separate, on account of the difference of words, and so on. The instances coming under this head of discussion are all those meditations on Brahman which have for their only result final Release, which consists in attaining to Brahman&amp;ndash;such as the meditation on that which is, the meditation on the bhūman, the meditation on the small space within the heart, the Upakośala meditation, the Śāṇḍilya meditation, the meditation on Vaiśvānara, the meditation on the Self of bliss, the meditation on the Imperishable, and others&amp;ndash;whether they be recorded in one śākhā only or in several śākhās.</description>

      <description>Option, on account of the non-difference of result. It has been proved that the meditation on that which truly is, the meditation on the small ether within the heart, and so on&amp;ndash;all of which have for their result the attainment to Brahman&amp;ndash;are separate meditations. The question now arises whether all these meditations should be combined by each meditating devotee, on account of such combination being useful to him; or whether, in the absence of any use of such combination, they should be</description>

      <description>They belong to the constituent members, as the bases. A doubt arises whether meditations such as the one enjoined in the text, &amp;lsquo;Let him meditate on the syllable Om as the Udgītha,&amp;rsquo; which are connected with constituent elements of the sacrifice such as the Udgītha, contribute towards the accomplishment of the sacrifice, and hence must be performed at the sacrifice as part of it; or whether they, like the godohana vessel, benefit the agent apart from the sacrifice, and therefore may be undertaken according to desire.</description>

      <description>And on account of injunction. The above conclusion is further confirmed by the fact of injunction, i.e. thereby that clauses such as &amp;lsquo;he is to meditate on the Udgītha&amp;rsquo; enjoin the meditation as standing to the Udgītha in the relation of a subordinate member. Injunctions of this kind differ from injunctions such as &amp;lsquo;he is to bring water in the godohana vessel for him who desires cattle&amp;rsquo;; for the latter state a special qualification on the part of him who performs the action, while the former do not, and hence cannot claim independence.</description>

      <description>On account of rectification. The text &amp;lsquo;from the seat of the Hotr̥ he sets right the wrong Udgīha&amp;rsquo; shows that the meditation is necessarily required for the purpose of correcting whatever mistake may be made in the Udgītha. This also proves that the meditation is an integral part of the sacrificial performance.</description>

      <description>And on account of the declaration of a quality being common (to all the Vedas). The text &amp;lsquo;By means of that syllable the threefold knowledge proceeds. With Oṁ the Adhvaryu gives orders,
with Oṁ the Hotr̥ recites, with Oṁ the Udgātr̥ sings,&amp;rsquo; which declares the praṇava&amp;ndash;which is a &amp;lsquo;quality&amp;rsquo; of the meditation, in so far as it is its basis&amp;ndash;to be common to the three Vedas, further shows that the meditation has to be employed in connexion with the sacrifice.</description>

      <description>Rather not, as the text does not declare their going together. It is not true that the meditations on the Udgītha and the rest are bound to the sacrifices in the same way as the Udgītha, and so on, themselves are; for Scripture does not declare that they go together with, i.e. are subordinate constituents of the Udgītha, and so on. The clause &amp;lsquo;Let him meditate on the Udgītha&amp;rsquo; does not indeed itself state another qualification on the part of the agent (i.</description>

      <description>And because (Scripture) shows it. A scriptural text, moreover, shows that the meditation is necessary for, and restricted to, the sacrificial performance. For the text &amp;lsquo;A Brahman priest who knows this saves the sacrifice, the sacrificcr, and all the officiating priests&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;which declares that all priests are saved through the knowledge of the Brahman&amp;ndash;has sense only on the understanding that that knowledge is not restricted to the Udjātr̥, and so on (i.</description>
