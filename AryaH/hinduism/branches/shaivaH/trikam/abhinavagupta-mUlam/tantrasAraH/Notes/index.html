They are: makara, kumbha, mina, meșa, vrṣa, and mit huna, while on the other half they are: karka, simha, kānyā, tulā, vrscika, and dhanu. Similarly, the sun&rsquo;s progress towards the north and towards the south, respectively, is also conceived of as occur ring in the breath. The period during which the sun moves to the north is considered to be the bestower of good results in the other world, while the period during which the sun proceeds towards the south is considered to be the bestower of good results in this mate</p>

<p>great dissolution (mahāpralaya). During this period all the paths (adhvas) remain dissolved in the state of equilibrium. The super intending deity known as Sadāśiva is dissolved in the primal sound (nāda). This primal sound is in turn dissolved into śakti, śakti into vyāpini and vyāpinī into samanā. In samanā there is no trace of time. It is the eyerlasting state. It is from this state that time arises like the opening and closing of the eyelids. Though all the limited souls rest in this supreme state of equilibrium, they do not attain</p>

Similarly, other spheres, e.g., the sphere of praksti, the sphere of māyā, and the sphere of śakti, are wider than the preced ing one. All the principles from water to prakrti come under the sphere of prakrti. All the principles from puruṣa to māyā come under the sphere of māyā. The extent of the sphere of śakti extends up to the Sadāśiva principle. Thus, the number of spheres (andas) is four. The spheres are the masses of substance which have fallen</p>

These worlds exist so that souls which have not received the Saiva form of initiation, but have attained a lower form of perfection through a continuous practice of concentration, receive a body and sense organs best suited for experiencing pleasure and pain in a particular world, and may finally attain identity with the Lord.

<p>Chapter Eight</p>
<p>ates all jars. The highest Lord, śiva, is far more extensive than any other generic attribute; therefore, he is the greatest universal by</p>
<p>whose light everything shines.</p>
<p>as, support, solidity, etc., are found, that is to be known as the earth principle. These characteristics of the earth are seen in the regions beginning with the all-consuming dreadful fire (kālāgni)</p>
<p>and ending in the world of Virabhadra.</p>
<p>at the emergence of creation, the universe is nothing but an expan sion, an &lsquo;opening up&rsquo; (sr̥ṣṭi) of the light of the autonomous Lord. The Lord is also the cause of &lsquo;maintenance&rsquo; (sthiti), i.e., the uni verse remaining steadily present within the Self; and &lsquo;withdrawal (saṁhāra), the state of rest in one&rsquo;s own Self. According to this theory, in reality no change has taken place in the Self, which is identical with consciousness. Furthermore, internality and exter nality are not distinct from each other, but two sides of the same reality. The artificial or fictional causal relation is not real, and is accepted only to help explain the state existing in māyā. The power of causal relation is limited and governed by the Lord&rsquo;s restrictive</p>
<p>power (niyati).</p>
<p>in the beginning and others follow it in a regular order. This order of sequence, in the form of priority and posteriority, remains invariably present; for example, the clay used in making a jar is</p>
<p>always present before the jar itself comes into existence.</p>
<p>the conscious agent is absent, the aggregation of all the causes, either individually or collectively, cannot produce the intended object. For example, even if the stick for moving the potter&rsquo;s wheel, clay, and other necessary materials for making a jar are present, the jar cannot be produced if the potter himself is absent. There fore, it is concluded that a conscious agent is required for produc240 NOTES</p>
<p>ing an effect. However, all of the above-mentioned instruments, along with the sentient agent, are considered as the cause of any</p>
<p>action which in reality terminates in consciousness.</p>
<p>controlled by the restrictive power of the Lord. Therefore, it is relative, but the absolute causal relation depends on none. Con sciousness shines in the form of the universe. For instance, all the principles (tattvas) from earth to śiva are dependent on the one prior to it. The earth is supported by the water, the water helps the earth for its solidity. Furthermore, all the elements are unable to come into being without the existence of subtle elements. In the same way, these subtle elements cannot come into existence with out the blossoming action of the sense organs. That again is impos sible without determination regarding different sense organs. This also is not possible without the existence of the primary matter inseparably and equally linked with all, which is known as mūlapraksti. This primary matter, being an enjoyable object, is unable to exist without the subject that enjoys it. The subject that experiences it is the sharer of the experience of different objects of experience. It is for that reason that it is considered limited. Thus, the limitation that is seen in a conscious subject (puruṣa) is only imposed and not real. This imposed limitation is due to kāla, kalā, niyati, rāga, and vidyā, which cannot be activated without con sciousness (samvit). However, consciousness, being partless, can not manifest without the existence of the delusive power called māyā. Freedom, the cause of limitation, has comparative distinc tions of manifestation. These features are shining in the beginning as slightly unlimited, then unlimited, then slightly blossoming and finally are fully bloomed. However, these states of the manifesta tions by the power of freedom could not be possible without that which is perfectly luminous by nature, which in this system is</p>
<p>called Bhairava.</p>
<p>in spite of the presence of the Absolute everywhere.</p>
<p>NOTES 241</p>
<p>it exists in a distant place. The question implied here is, how could</p>
<p>the universe be created by a Lord who remains distant?</p>
<p>from desire. In the state of māyā, the limited soul feels a longing for an object in order to fulfill his desires. The desire arises in the limited soul because of some want in him. The Lord, on the other hand, does not lack anything. Therefore, there is no question of any desire in him. However, on account of his freedom, a sort of intention toward tasting of his delight continuously goes on. The pentad-named śiva, śakti, sadāśiva, īśvara, and śuddhavidyā, who abide in the pure path (adhva), shine with comparative intensity from the relish of the taste of delight on account of his autonomy. It is because of the comparative intensity of this relish that con sciousness manifests itself as &ldquo;I&rdquo; (aham). This is known as the state of śakti. In other words, consciousness which is absolute (anuttara) now sees (as if), on the mirror of consciousness, its own reflection and cognizes it to be its own, then the cognition that fol lows is “I am This” (aham idam). In this instance, the substratum where it shines is “I” and “This&rdquo; shines as an indistinct outline of the picture. In the cognition, &ldquo;I am This,&rdquo; &ldquo;I” is the principal and &ldquo;This&rdquo; has the subordinate position. The principle known as sadāśiva abides where the host of the subjects called mantreśvara cognizes the universal light of consciousness as “I am This.” But on the level of the knowing subjects called mantreśvara, this cog nition assumes the form of “This is I,&rdquo; where &ldquo;This” is vividly prominent and “I” is subordinate. This principle is called isvara, where “This” as the knowable shines with “I,&rdquo; invariably one with it. In śuddhavidyā, on the other hand, there is no distinction between principality and subordinacy. There both “I” and “This&rdquo;</p>
<p>shine in a balanced way.</p>
<p>as sakala, pralayākala, vijñānākala, mantra, mantreśvara, mantramaheśvara, and śiva. Impurities are of three kinds. They are ānava, māyīya, and kārma. The āṇavamala is of two kinds.</p>
<p>242 NOTES</p>
<p>First, it lacks right knowledge regarding the Self, which is of the nature of consciousness. The second is the wrong notion of con ceiving non-self, that is, the body, the sense organs, prāṇa, etc., as the Self. The impurity born of māyā (māyīya) causes the notion of difference. The impurity born of deeds (karma) appears to the soul to be of the nature of virtue and vice. Impurities are considered to be the bond by which souls remain bound to worldly existence. The knowing subjects who have all of the above three defilements (mala) are called sakala. The souls known as pralayākala have two such impurities, i.e., āṇava and karma. The vijñānākala souls have only one mala. They are of two kinds: (a) free vijñānākala souls, in which all·impurities have ended, and (b) vijñānākala souls, in: which some trace of impurity still persists. From among the first group, eight vidyeśvaras are selected, and from the second group</p>

<p>a guna principle (tattva) is supposed to exist. It is only an aspect of praksti, the balanced state of three guṇas. Therefore, the balanced state of guṇas is called prakrti and its agitated aspect is known as guṇa tattva. However, guṇa is not counted as a distinct principle from praksti. The impelling force that agitates or breaks the bal ance of prakrti is the superintending deity of the tattva. The agita tion in praksti occurs in relation to those who desire enjoyment, but in those in whom these desires of enjoyment have disappeared, this agitation does not create any effect. According to the Trika</p>
<p>system, agitation in praksti is caused by the.Lord Srikanthaṇātha.</p>
<p>purusa is sentient but non-active either in bondage or in liberation. Therefore, some external agent of agitation is required. According to Saiva philosophy, agitation is created by the intervention of</p>

<p>seven kinds of knowing subjects (pramātā) residing on the seven</p>

<p>244 NOTES</p>
<p>ing subjects. The sakala knowing subjects are capable of perceiv ing only the principles from earth to praksti. The higher knowing subjects, who possess more extensive subjectivity and therefore possess qualitatively different energies (śaktis), are capable of per</p>
<p>ceiving the higher principles.</p>
<p>The principles from earth to praksti are divided into fifteen on the basis of the (seven) possessors of power (śaktimān), their powers (śaktis), along with their &lsquo;unique nature&rsquo; or thing in itself&rsquo;, (svarūpa). There are thir-: teen divisions from puruṣa to kalā; eleven divisions [exist] when the pralayakala [group of knowing sub jects) becomes the thing in itself, it is similar with māyā; [there are] nine divisions when the thing in itself becomes vijnanakala; seven divisions [manifest] when the man tra [knowing subjects) becomes the unique nature; a threefold division [arises) when the mantramahesvaras become the unique nature. Śiva, whose nature is con sciousness, which is dance of uninterrupted light, has no</p>
<p>division.</p>

<p>energy nor the possessor of energy.</p>
<p>non-transcendent (apara), transcendent-non-transcendent (parā para), and transcendent (para). In other words, reality is primarily conceived as possessing an objective side (nara), energy (śakti), and a possessor of the energy (śaktimān). However, Abhi navagupta points out that the thing in itself&rsquo; (svarūpa) is the sphere of objectivity, the śākta is the sphere of perception, and the possessor of power is the perceiver or knowing subject. Therefore, all seven knowing subjects are śiva, who possesses different ener gies, that is, different powers in the different spheres in which they operate. The thing in itself is common to all of them, which pro vides a degree of objectivity.</p>

<p>attempts to refute &lsquo;doctrine of perceptibility&rsquo; advocated by the Mīmāṁsā school. According to the Mīmāṁsā theory, in order to be perceived, every object must possess a quality of perceptibility; any object devoid of this quality cannot be perceived. Abhi navagupta disagrees and attempts to prove that perceptibility is not the quality of an object, but a power possessed by the perceiver. All entities already exist within consciousness, and when a given entity appears within the organs of perception of a perceiver, then it becomes an object of perception. Everything is illuminated by consciousness, including defilement (mala), as well as non-exis tence, because for a thing to be non-existent, it must be included in consciousness. Therefore, objective existence depends on con sciousness, and is not perceptible independently from it. For Abhi navagupta, it is important to establish this position, because he needs to argue that the knowing subject must develop a higher level of subjectivity to be able to perceive the larger and subtler spheres of reality.</p>

<p>tions to hold all the principles (tattvas) in their respective places For example, the principle earth is held by the subtle energy called dhārikā. As the function of this energy is to contain or stop the earth, it is also called nivstti. Similarly, the subtle energies called pratiṣthā, vidyā, and śānta are active in other principles or in</p>
<p>groups of them. .:</p>
<p>one sphere from the other. They are also called coverings or veils</p>
<p>(āvaraṇa) which do not allow one sphere to penetrate another.</p>
<p>belonging to earth and other tattvas exist also in the śakti tattva; however, their existence is not in the gross form but in the subtle. This is the reason why śiva is ritually worshipped in the phallic</p>
<p>form made of five different elements.</p>
<p>tations, or thought constructs.</p>
<p>If an object of meditation were to exist in it, it would not be tran scendent. Therefore, the kala that functions in the lower level, just below the highest, is known as śāntā. However, śiva is beyond</p>
<p>śāntā; therefore, no name is suitable to describe the Immutable One.</p>
<p>but when the quality of being an object of knowledge disappears from the heart of the yogin, that which remains is known as thirty six principles. Even if, for the purpose of teaching, in that state, the divine is conceived as the thirty-seventh principle, then upon the disappearance of even this objectivity from it, the divine is conceived as the thirty-eighth principle.</p>

<p>of all manifestations and activities. What is contained in the first ten chapters of this work constitutes a short-cut for a small number of truth-seekers who, according to this system, have been pursuing spiritual perfection over many lifetimes. The significance of this</p>
<p>knowledge for others is made clear in this chapter.</p>
<p>the karma of all deeds. For one undergoing the experience of past deeds, it is necessary to remain involved in actions whose fruits are to be experienced in the future. The doer has to experience the results of past actions gradually, not all at once. There is no end to the cycle of deeds or their results, and for this reason the descent of grace (śaktipāta) needs to be discussed. According to the posi tion represented here, when śakti &lsquo;opens up in one&rsquo;s own self,</p>
<p>right knowledge dawns spontaneously.</p>
<p>site past actions. Both of these actions possess exactly equal power, and therefore restrict each other from producing any fruit. Accord ing to this theory, śaktipāta takes place when these two deeds are</p>
<p>balanced and their results neutralized.</p>
<p>restrain (nirodhikā) arrests the mala. When impurities (mala) become perfectly ripened, the above śakti becomes inactive, and the proper manifestation of knowledge and action occurs. This cul minates in the decent of grace (śaktipāta) on a seeker.250 NOTES</p>

<p>In the process of manifestation, the supreme Lord (Parameśvara) creates limited beings by concealing (tirobhāva) His own Self through kancukas, tattvas, and the malas. He reveals his own Self by bestowing śaktipāta on-limited souls. The entire process of con cealment and revelation is the result of the autonomy (svātantrya)</p>
<p>of the Lord.</p>
<p>tial and therefore there is no object, activity, or person that He</p>

<p>śāstras.</p>

<p>NOTES 251</p>
<p>same way, one should purify the whole body, beginning with head and ending with feet, by uttering the mantra of śiva with its five limbs (Isana is the head, Tatpurusa is the face, Aghora is the heart, Vāmadeva is the hidden parts of the body, and Sadyojāta is the whole body). Then, having cleansed the body with the mantra, one should plunge into the water repeating the mantra of śiva with its auxiliary parts. This is known as bathing with water. Taking ashes from the sacrificial fire, one should burn impurities present on the head, face, heart, genitals, and the feet with it while uttering the mantra &ldquo;phat.” When this is done one should throw a handful of these ashes on the head while repeating the mantra of śiva with its five limbs. This is known as bathing with ashes. One should move back and forth in the pleasing air, remembering the mantra, given to him by his guru, in his heart. This is known as bathing with air. One should bring the mantra into one&rsquo;s mind and should remain concentrated there fixing his concentration on the void (ākāśa). This is known as bathing in the void. One who immerses oneself in the light of the sun and the moon, identifying himself with śiva, is cleansed of all impurities. This type of bathing is called soma and arka. The last type of bath is bathing in the Self (ātmā). In the Tan traloka, Abhinavagupta describes it in the following way: “The very Self is the supreme Lord himself; it is free from disciplines established in spiritual texts. It is like a great lake in extension and depth; the universe should dissolve therein, upon which one</p>
<p>becomes pure and the cause of purification for others.”</p>

<p>describing the procedure for selecting a suitable place for worship, mantra repetition, and practice of yoga. He discusses this topic in Chapter 15 of his TĀ, verses 80-115ab. At the very beginning, Abhinavagupta points out that only when one is serene and well</p>
<p>252 NOTES</p>
<p>disposed in his heart (bhāvam prasannam ālocya) is he suitable to perform worship, and only then should he proceed to the place of</p>
<p>worship.</p>
<p>the worship should take place: &ldquo;The suitable place&ndash;for either attaining perfection or liberation with regard to the practice of worship, mantra repetition, or attainment of samādhi-is the one</p>
<p>where heart is inclined toward beauty and at peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>various participants in action presented by a sentence. The closest equivalent in other classical and some modern languages is a word</p>
<p>&lsquo;case,&rsquo; such as nominative, genitive, accusative, ablative, etc.</p>
<p>ity, has to account for ritual action, which consists of factors or participants in action presented by a sentence (kārakas), which because of their perceived distinction could be construed as con tradicting nonduality. This was certainly the opinion of Samkara cārya and other Advaita Vedānta thinkers; Abhinavagupta dis agreed with this understanding and argues that action, distinction, change, etc., are also included within consciousness. To illustrate, we can take the example of the following sentence: I offer water from the sacrificial pot to Lord śiva with a spoon in the place of worship. The factors here are: the agent of acting, the object of the act, its instrument, its point of ablation, and the location of the act of worship. For Samkarācārya, the supreme reality cannot be of the same order as that of objective existence which is transient in nature. The Brahman is the transcendent, immutable, and partless reality, and all subjective and objective phenomena are only appearances possessing no real existence. The Brahman is without attributes and as immutable, it cannot be subject to action. The attribute of changeability is the most important characteristic of objective existence, and therefore ever-changing empirical exis tence must have a ground on which all these changes take place. The same, of course, applies to the ritual action, which, as we have</p>
<p>NOTES 253</p>
<p>seen, consists of the factors or the participants in action described by a sentence. For Abhinavagupta, on the other hand, the supreme reality, which consists of prakāśa and vimarśa, even in the process of externalization, remains established in its own Self, &lsquo;relishing&rsquo; (camatkāra) the bliss of &lsquo;fullness&rsquo; (pūrnatā), and &lsquo;independence&rsquo; (svātantrya) of its own essential nature, which is in no way over shadowed by the external manifestation. The lower aspect of cre ation is a contracted form of that supreme consciousness, which, through the activity of māyā śakti, assumes limited forms, thus bringing into existence the notion of duality. Thus, the supreme reality consists as much of differentiation as it does of unity. This differentiation always remains within that I-Consciousness and therefore is never separate from it. Thus, unlike Samkara for whom action is always binding, Abhinavagupta accepts action,</p>
<p>such as the ritual activity, as potentially liberating.</p>

Every thing is purified by it and what is impure becomes pure&rdquo; (TĀ 15: 162-163ab.) However, the impurity only belongs to the limited knowing subject abiding in māyā and is not the essential nature of things: “Here we speak of impurity from the perspective of bonded souls and of their systems. The essential nature of all things remains in fact always the same, without changing from what it</p>
<p>was earlier or what is conceived to be” (TĀ 15: 163cd-164ab.)</p>

<p>form of initiation which joins the animal with the higher principles</p>
<p>and for the purpose of propitiating God.</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen</p>
<p>Ordinarily, the initiation is not given to all, and one desirous of initiation needs to show his devotion to teacher, deities, or scrip tures. This devotion is, in turn, seen as an indication of the descent of grace (śaktipāta), and śaktipāta is perceived as a definite sign that one is suitable for initiation. The conditions under which the teacher is expected to grant initiation to a dying person are described by Abhinavagupta in the TĀ 19: 4-6: When in a dying person, the fall of even weak power is awakened-whether he is taken by devotion to a teacher and others; whether the fall of grace is through work of friends, relatives, etc., whether he has been indeed regular (samayin) but has not obtained the supreme initiation; whether, already having obtained it, he desires to leave as soon as possible his vital breaths, desirous of going away-the teacher should provide for him the initiation of immediate depar ture, free from impurities. However, the teacher must be careful not to give initiation to a person whose impurities (malas) haven&rsquo;t reach maturation, or to one whose karma hasn&rsquo;t been exhausted (seṣakarmikavigrahe). The commentator explains this compound to mean: one who is not about to die, that is, one whose prārabdhakarma hasn&rsquo;t been fully exhausted.</p>
<p>256 NOTES</p>
<p>the qualifications a teacher needs to have to perform this kind of initiation in the following way: &ldquo;This initiation, which provides exit from the body, must be performed by a teacher who is experi enced in yoga. How could one who has not practiced various prāṇayama exercises be in a position to affect it&rdquo; (TĀ19:23cd 24ab). (The brahmavidya) is in a position of producing its effects automatically, such as the purification of the principles, etc. The teacher, thanks to the power of ritual action and mantras, can thus join the disciple with the supreme principle (tattva). Even if a teacher hasn&rsquo;t practiced yoga, he is nevertheless in a position to execute the initiation that provides immediate exit from the body,</p>
<p>thanks to the power of ritual action, mantras, and meditation.</p>
<p>entitled to recite brahmavidyā. By this recitation, the dying person</p>
<p>receives the samaya type of initiation. See TĀ 19:</p>
<p>giving signs,&rsquo; as, for example, a person&rsquo;s dead body is re-animated</p>
<p>by the power of mantra and lifts itself, etc.</p>
<p>foolish individuals. It is described by Abhinavagupta in TĀ 20:2–7: The teacher, completely intent upon reciting appropriate mantras, must meditate on his right hand in the form of a triangle of fire, completely flaming, resplendent with the phoneme of fire, stirred by a wheel of winds, and must place there any seed and meditate on how it is burning, both in the hand and within his heart. In this way the seed, consumed by the heat of a multitude of &ldquo;phat&rdquo; mantras enlivened by the phonemes of fire &ldquo;ra,&rdquo; loses every seminal quality and is now incapable of germinating. At the same time, by virtue of this same procedure, based on the power of mantras, meditation, and rituals, the three malas (āṇava, māyiya, and kārma) are also &lsquo;burned in the sense that they are no longer in a position to furnish</p>
<p>NOTES 257</p>
<p>their products. This initiation, which has as its purpose the destruc tion of the seed, was described to me by the venerable śambhunātha in his benevolence. The teacher, out of mercy, can also join the seed to śiva. The initiation is, in fact, full of splendor (sudipta), and is in</p>
<p>a position to grant liberation also to vegetable life.</p>
<p>weight of a disciple, Abhinavagupta connects with the five stages of repose, that is, pragānanda, udbhava, kampa, nidrā, and ghūrṇi described in Chapter Five of Tantrasāra. In TĀ 20: 14-15ab, he clarifies: “The leap (udbhava) is due to relief, caused by an eclips ing of the corporeal influence (dehagraha). The body is essentially constituted by the elements of earth. When the teacher, thanks to: the mantra of lightness, which will be explained later, meditates on the disciple rising into the air, he loses his earthly qualities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>deity, or śāstras which would entitle him to receive initiation, as this devotion is perceived as a clear sign of śaktipāta. However, in the case of the deceased or the absent one, this is obviously impos sible. Yet, the teacher would perform such an initiation if he could in some way infer that śaktipāta had descended on such a person. The signs of this type of śaktipāta are, for example: strong feelings that a teacher himself, for some unknown reason, had for a deceased or absent soul, or the strong persistence of the family</p>
<p>that advocated initiation.</p>

<p>ple in the course of initiation. To which principle one is joined will depend on the school of thought whose initiation one receives. However, according to the Trika school, other schools of thought do not possess the knowledge to enable a disciple to attain identity with śiva. Therefore, those who have received initiation into what the followers of Trika consider inferior sects should be first dis joined or drawn away from the principles that they were joined to by the previous initiation, and then initiated again. The process of transcending the inferior doctrines is accomplished gradually through a succession of steps: the descent of grace, the removal of impurities, the desire to find the right teacher, initiation, knowl edge, the abandonment of that which is to be avoided, immersion into that which is to be accepted, giving up the sphere of the enjoy able, and the removal of the limitations created by āṇavamala. For</p>

<p>should transmit his own power (svādhikara) to a disciple whom he thinks is at the point of being in possession of well-practiced knowledge. &ldquo;The one,&rdquo; continues Abhinavagupta, quoting Kami kāgama, &ldquo;who does not possess this knowledge is not a teacher,</p>
<p>NOTES 259</p>
<p>even if he has been anointed and has passed through the various stages, such as samayin, etc.” Furthermore, the only criterion for the selection of a new teacher is knowledge. Abhinavagupta writes, &ldquo;The teacher who creates a new teacher must therefore select an individual of full and perfect knowledge, without considering any other characteristic, such as place, family, conduct, and body.&rdquo; TA</p>
<p>23:16b-17a.</p>
<p>newly consecrated teacher in the immediate period after his initia tion. He writes: &ldquo;The new teacher, after having obtained consecra tion, must meditate and recite the entire complex of mantras estab lished in the scriptures for a period of six months so that he becomes one with them. Having attained identity with the mantras, and having taken possession of the potency of mantra (mantra virya), he finally becomes able to cut the bonds. Therefore, he</p>
<p>should spare no effort to attain identity with the mantras.&rdquo;</p>
<p>yas, Vaisyas, eunuchs, women, Sudras, and any other kinds of per son desirous of initiation should be initiated without being asked their caste. However, the teacher should take this into consider ation at the time when knowledge is imparted to them. Further more, the teacher, who is the basis of knowledge, should set seven sessions. These sessions are: initiation, explanation, compassion, friendliness, contemplation of the śāstras, unification with śiva, and giving away of food, etc. See TĀ 23:20b/23a.</p>

<p>that will be described in the following lines is performed to estab lish firm conviction on the side of the ignorant ones. The entire performance by the teacher, according to Abhinavagupta, is not helpful in any way in attaining liberation. See TĀ 24:15b-16a.260 NOTES</p>
<p>Abhinavagupta discusses it in Chapter 25 of his TĀ based on the authority of the Siddhayogesvarimata Tantra. This rite must be per formed on the third, fourth, and tenth day after death, every month</p>
<p>in the first year. After that, it should be performed once every year.</p>
<p>must take in hand, first of all, the offering (naivedyam), and after having meditated that in this offering abides śakti of the nature of food in the form of potency instrumental in nourishing, he must conceive that the dead person for whose sake this rite is performed is penetrated by it. The bound part in the form of enjoyable of this dead disciple must then be offered by a teacher to the enjoying sub- . ject in identity with him. In this way, the disciple becomes śiva.&rdquo;</p>

<p>kept secret. The practitioner should attain identity with the potency of the mantra (mantravirya), without which mantras</p>
<p>NOTES 261</p>
<p>remain ineffective. Furthermore, mantras should be received directly from a teacher who has himself attained identity with the potency of the mantra, and not from some book. In TĀ26: 20-24ab, Abhinavagupta writes:</p>
<p>“The fundamental rule is the following: namely, the man tric form is not to be revealed by the teacher to the dis ciple in written form, especially in our system, which is superior to all. The mantras are of the nature of pho nemes, and phonemes are of the nature of reflective con sciousness. They can be transmitted to the disciple only if . it is not separated from the consciousness of the teacher. &hellip; Written mantras àre, on the other hand, stripped of their</p>
<p>potency and therefore unreal. Because of the conven tional meaning which clouds them, their natural splendor doesn&rsquo;t manifest from books.&quot; However, it has been stated in the Siddhayogesvarīmata that those who, in spite of adopting mantras from books, attain identity with its potency, are purified by Bhairava and spontaneously initiated. “Once mantras have been invoked,&quot; continues Abhinavagupta, “it is necessary to satisfy them and propitiate them with flowers, liquor, offerings of food and incense, proportionately to the fate, devotion, and capabilities of the worshipper. The śakti, nāda, and other mantras, which are especially fer vent, must be satisfied with liquor, meat, and blood at the beginning, and only afterwards with flowers, incense,</p>
<p>etc.&quot; (TA 26:51b-53a.)</p>
<p>formed in nature. Among all the types of unmanifest lingas, those not made by human hand are considered to be the most excellent ones. Therefore, these types of lingas are highly recommended for the purpose of ritual worship. However, manifest, or vyakta lingas, can also be used in rituals, Abhinavagupta writes: “The teacher can, if he wishes, install a manifest linga (vyakta) in the form of an image or painting found in a picture or book, made of wood, gold, or crafted by an expert and initiated artist” (TĀ 27:19b-20a).</p>
<p>262 NOTES</p>
<p>Lingas can be made of various materials, such as &ldquo;little stones, gems, pearls, flowers, food, clothes, and perfumed substances. Lingas of stone created by artists, and so also those of metals, with the exception of gold ones, should be avoided&rdquo; (TĀ 27: 12-13). Abhinavagupta points out that various measures, given in various texts, regarding the size and shape of lingas, and other concerns, are of little importance because: &ldquo;The linga which grants the desired fruit is in fact only the one that has been illuminated by</p>
<p>mantra, animated by its noble potency” (TĀ 27: 14b).</p>
<p>that are indispensable observances (nitya) has been completed. In this section, the description of occasional observances (naimittika) begins. Abhinavagupta derives the word &lsquo;parva&rsquo; from two roots:: the first root, pr,&rsquo; which means &rsquo;to fill,&rsquo; is combined with the suf fix &lsquo;van.&rsquo; The other root is &lsquo;parv,&rsquo; which also means &rsquo;to fill&rsquo;; thus a celebration of a festival day is called &lsquo;parvadinam,&rsquo; because on</p>
<p>that day consciousness attains fulfillment.</p>
<p>sacrifice of the wheel (cakrayāga) is mūrtiyāga. The cakrayāga or mūrtiyāga is of five types. Abhinavagupta writes:</p>
<p>The sacrifice of the wheel is of five types, namely: soli tary (kevala), coupled (yāmala), mixed (miśra), cou pling of the wheel (cakrayuk), and mingling of heroes (vīrasaṁkara). The solitary, in this context, is one in which only the teacher take part; the mixed is one in which disciples also take part, along with their wives; the coupled is of two kinds, based on whether the women who participated were wives or hired courtesans; the cou pling of the wheel is so-called because this is the type of sacrifice associated with the wheel, which because of the unification of śaktis grants all desired fruits; finally the sacrifice in which everybody participates is called min</p>
<p>gling of the heroes. (TĀ 28: 78b-82a.)</p>
<p>scriptures: &ldquo;Each of these ten types of teachers has assumed a human body and possesses a particular mental disposition, but are all identical with śiva, although they are different from each other through knowledge and action. They are all dedicated to the scrip tures, to worship, to the initiation rites, to sexual union, meat, and liquor. There are secondary divisions among these due to possess ing different mental dispositions, such as tranquility (calmness),</p>
<p>anger, or patience, etc.&rdquo; (TA 28: 391a-</p>
<p>other sacrifices, but in all of these instances this worship is an accessory part of the sacrifice. On the other hand, this ritual is primarily devoted to satisfying or pleasing the teacher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Union of all the Šāstras.&rsquo; In it, Abhinavagupta presents his vision that brings together the great variety of agamic texts, both Hindu and non-Hindu. In his analysis, he grants all of them the status of being authoritative or being a valid means of gaining knowledge (pramāna). However, he arranges them in a hierarchi</p>
<p>cal order, placing the Trika sastras at the apex.</p>
<p>others emerge. This broad acceptance of all sastras requires him to attempt a reconciliation of their differences. In order to accom plish this, he points out that all of them bring about the promised fruit. In this way, Sāṁkhya gives to its follower the knowledge to discriminate between purusa and prakrti. Similarly, the follower of Buddhism attains the buddhi tattva, but only the Trika grants full and complete liberation to those who are entitled (adhikari). For Abhinavagupta, an adhikari is one who possesses firm faith in a given agama. Another question that arises here is: if it is true that all agamas emerge from one and the same source, then why is it necessary to perform a ritual of conversion, such as &lsquo;reclamation of linga&rsquo; (lingouddhāra)? Abhinavagupta explains:</p>
<p>In the body of one single doctrine, as for example, in the Vedas, it happens that its followers, in order to attain to superior degrees or ranks, must submit to special rites of purification. The same thing can be said in regard to our tradition, as for example, in the case of the reclama tion of the linga, etc. In other words, in the way in which one belonging to a lower āśrama cannot enjoy the fruits which come from the upper aśrama, in the same way, a follower of the Pāñcarātras, etc., cannot attain the iden</p>
<p>tity with Śiva. (TĀ 35:28-</p>
<p>knowledge that is necessarily based in an omniscient knowing sub ject and is the basis of all human activity.</p>
