Rāmānuja’s Nityagrantham (“Manual of Daily Worship”): A Translation
Francis X. Clooney
0 Translator’s Preface Rāmānuja (1017–1137) was a philosopher and theologian; a saint and mystic, a lover of God; a proponent of the harmony of Tamil and Sanskrit traditions; and a premier leader of the South Indian Hindu Śrīvaiṣṇava community and a reformer of its ritual practices. Nine works are attributed to him:
Vedārtha-saṃgraha, on the right interpretation of the Upaniṣads and the right use of them in the theological and spiritual practice of the devotee; the Gītā-bhāṣya, commentary on the Bhagavad Gītā; the Śrī-bhāṣya, commentary on the Brahmasūtras; 4–5) the Vedānta-dīpā and the Vedāntasāra (summaries of Rāmānuja’s reading the Brahmasūtras); (6–8) three long prose prayers of surrender to Nārāyaṇa with the Goddess Śrī— surrender to God within oneself: Śaraṇāgati-gadya, surrender at the temple: Śrīraṅga-gadya, and surrender eschatologically, in heaven: Śrīvaikuṇṭha-gadya; and the Nitya-grantham or Nityam." />

<p>Rāmānuja’s Nityagrantham (“Manual of Daily Worship”): A Translation<br>
Francis X. Clooney</p>
<h2 id="0">0</h2>
<h3 id="translators-preface">Translator’s Preface</h3>
<p>Rāmānuja (1017–1137) was a philosopher and theologian; a saint and mystic, a lover of God; a proponent of the harmony of Tamil and Sanskrit traditions; and a premier leader of the South Indian Hindu Śrīvaiṣṇava community and a reformer of its ritual practices. Nine works are attributed to him:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Vedārtha-saṃgraha, on the right interpretation of the Upaniṣads and the right use of them in the theological and spiritual practice of the devotee;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>the Gītā-bhāṣya, commentary on the Bhagavad Gītā;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>the Śrī-bhāṣya, commentary on the Brahmasūtras;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>4–5) the Vedānta-dīpā and the Vedāntasāra (summaries of Rāmānuja’s reading the Brahmasūtras);</li>
<li>(6–8) three long prose prayers of surrender to Nārāyaṇa with the Goddess Śrī—
<ul>
<li>surrender to God within oneself: Śaraṇāgati-gadya,</li>
<li>surrender at the temple: Śrīraṅga-gadya, and</li>
<li>surrender eschatologically, in heaven: Śrīvaikuṇṭha-gadya; and</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="9">
<li>the Nitya-grantham or Nityam.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anne-Marie Esnoul published a French translation of the Nityam in 1972. This, the last, least studied of Rāmānuja’s works, is the text translated here into English. This is, I believe, the first full English translation.</p>
<p>In an essay, Robert C. Lester (1966)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> disputed Rāmānuja’s authorship of the Gadyatraya, and by extension the Nityam (though he does not study it in his essay), due to style, terminology, and theological content.</p>
<p>Today’s scholars have remained neutral regarding authorship. While Lester’s points have merited and received due consideration, they are not decisive. There seems to be no convincing reason not to accept the very ancient and consistent attribution of the Gadyas and the Nityam to Rāmānuja. Indeed, very early Śrīvaiṣṇava records count the Gadyas and the Nityam among the master’s works. For example, āndhrapūrṇa’s Yatirājavaibhavam mentions the Gadyas and Nityam in verses 73 and 74:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then, once on the (day of the) Uttaraphālguni asterism in the Phālguna month, the lord of ascetics (Rāmānuja) with joy took refuge with Raṇganāyikā and Raṇganātha who had been bathed (in the sacred waters), and he uttered the Gadyatraya. By his composition called the Nityam Yatirāja taught the service to be undertaken till the end of one’s life by one who has understood reality by means of the Bhāṣya and other texts, who has surrendered himself to the Lord of Śrī by the Gadyas, and whose every activity is focused on Him.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My premise then is that the Nityam is properly understood, appreciated, and to be accounted for as Rāmānuja’s own work, in keeping with tradition and in the absence of any compelling argument against his authorship.</p>
<p>The Nityam is a ritual text indebted to the Vaiṣṇava Hindu theological-ritual tradition obscurely known as Pāñcarātra (“Of the Five Nights”). It follows many standard ritual practices of that tradition, involving the recitation of mantras, offerings of honorific objects (water, incense, flowers, etc.) to the Lord, enactments of morning ablutions, the donning of fresh garments, food offerings, as well as invocations of the many lesser beings in the Lord’s heavenly court within a Vaiṣṇava cosmological frame. Distinctive to the Nityam are the moments of intense meditation, the meditative assertion that the Lord alone is the true agent of the worship (while the worshiper is merely the instrument), and the ideal of worship as service seeking no reward in return.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Nityam Rāmānuja describes very concisely and intensely a fundamental aspect of the way of life of the paramaikānti, the bhagavatkaiṃkaryaikarati, the person who is single-mindedly focused on the Highest and whose sole pleasure lies in service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Despite its complexity, the Nityam manifests a clear structure. In my outline, I have divided it into three major parts.</p>
<p>Part One, “Routine Preparations, Recollection of the Act of Taking Refuge, and Interior Preparations” (six sections), prescribes</p>
<ul>
<li>routine purifications of the self and the place of yāga and pūjā;</li>
<li>a recollection of one’s already accomplished taking of refuge;</li>
<li>a recitation of the prayer of refuge from the Śaraṇāgatigadyam;</li>
<li>for the sake of the yāga to follow, the mental dissolution and recreation of oneself, bodily and spiritually;</li>
<li>and further preparation for the pūjā that will follow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part Two, “Yāga: Contemplative Ascent to the Lord’s Heaven, and Return” (five sections), details the contemplative worship (yāga), which may be best conceived of as an ascent that traverses the Lord’s universe up to his feet, a path marked by many acts of obeisance and many mantras, and then a similar descent to the place where personal worship is to occur.</p>
<p>Finally, Part Three, “Pūjā: Intimate Worship of the Lord” (eight sections), undertakes the day’s intimate worship of the Lord in the actions of pūjā,</p>
<ul>
<li>including the bath,</li>
<li>the meal, and</li>
<li>a sharing of the Lord’s prasādam with ācārya and the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>While commentaries call this “external” worship, it may likewise be conceived of as an interior practice.</p>
<p>Intermingled with these practices, particularly in Part Two, we find the repeated recitation of mantras. Most important, though never actually given, is the “root mantra” (mūla-mantra), oṃ namo nārāyaṇāya (Oṁ, obeisance to Nārāyaṇa).</p>
<p>The recollection of the performer’s original act of taking refuge (śaraṇāgati) establishes this performer as paramaikānti. At the end (Section XX), this performer reaffirms this act of taking refuge that has already and definitively been performed. Consequently too, and in accord with the theology of taking refuge, the performer cannot but assert that the Lord alone is the real agent of worship (sections II, V, VII, and XVIII). The practice and faith fundamental to the tradition is thus presented in a way that it is repeatedly affirmed, reenacted on a daily basis in the context of worship.</p>
<p>Much can be said about the place of the Nityam in the context of Rāmānuja’s other eight works, and I have begun to write about this contextualization elsewhere.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>We can see in the Nityam the exemplary daily practice of the person who has taken refuge and who has imbibed the intellectual and spiritual wisdom of Rāmānuja’s other works. From the vantage point of the Nityam, we are given a clear sense of what those other works are for, where they are heading when rightly understood, appropriated, and internalized. Of course, the Nityam stands in a special relationship to the Śaraṇāgatigadya, which is quoted in Section IV of the Nityam. It seems to serve as the frame or channel within which that passionate prayer can be located, so that it can be repeated over and again with a passion and force that does not diminish over time. For Rāmānuja, the best religious thinking, the best theology, smoothly overflows into practice, lived out in an ideal manner.</p>
<p>For Śrīvaiṣṇavas, whether it be literally practiced or not on a daily basis, the Nityam offers a powerful reinforcement of the original act of taking refuge, contemplated and reenacted on the cosmic stage, so to speak, yet too in the intimacy of daily, close-up worship. For interested readers from outside the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition, it is an intense, practical introduction into Rāmānuja’s intellectual and spiritual world. If read attentively, Nityam will also affect how we think of Rāmānuja as Vedāntin, since it shows us new dimensions of him as a pious practitioner, whose intellectual production is in the service of spiritual and moral practices. For all of us, it is a key that (re)opens the works of this familiar thinker from a fresh angle, showing the trajectory of his works toward praise and worship as the regular way of life of the devotee who understands tradition properly and wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>I have consulted Anne-Marie Esnoul’s 1972 French translation of the Nityagrantham, the very thorough and clear 2009 Sanskrit Vivṛti by N. S. Ramabhadracharya, the 2010 Tamil edition with Tamil elaboration by N. S. Krishna Ayyangar Swami, the 2014 English-language gist of the Nityam by K. R. Krishnaswami, and the 2017 Tamil translation by M. A. Venkatakrishnan.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>I have followed Marion Rastelli in using the 1956 edition by P. B. Annangarachariar, and I have also consulted the 1971 edition which incorporates some corrections. The parenthetical numbers appearing throughout the text as the end of some sections of the Sanskrit—(1), (2) etc.—are from that edition. The Roman numerals prefixed to various sections—I, II, III—are my own additions based on my sense of the whole and in the hope of making clearer the structure of the worship.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>This is not a critical edition, even if I have consulted various editions of the text, and on a very few occasions felt it prudent to emend the text in places. My goal has rather been to offer a fairly literal translation that makes Rāmānuja’s ritual, devotional, and theological masterpiece— his Vedānta in action— accessible to a much wider audience than has been possible until now. I will, of course, welcome the suggestions and corrections of scholars. Readability, with respect to both the Sanskrit and the English, has therefore been a goal. In my rendering of Sanskrit I have similarly sought to make the reading easier, by the addition of hyphens throughout. To the same end, in the translation I have often broken very long sentences into smaller ones. My hope, in the end, is to have made a contribution to our understanding of Rāmānuja by this translation, and thus to honor his memory just after the one thousandth anniversary of his birth.</p>

He offers obeisance to the divine world,

He offers obeisance to the home of the divine populace,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Śrīvaikuṇṭha, home of the divine populace,” He offers obeisance to the divine city, Śrīvaikuṇṭha,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Śrīvaikuṇṭha, the divine city,”
He offers obeisance to the divine palace,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Śrīvaikuṇṭha, the divine palace,”
He offers obeisance to the jeweled pavilion,
123
Rāmānuja’s Nityagrantham (“Manual of Daily Worship”): A Translation 359
“Oṁ, obeisance to the jeweled pavilion made of bliss,”
And in that place he offers obeisance to the cushion of herbs, “Oṁ, obeisance to Ananta [, king of snakes].”

Still higher,
He sets the southeast (āgneya) quarter,
“Oṁ, obeisance to dharma.”
He sets the southwest (nairṛtya) quarter,
“Oṁ, obeisance to knowledge.”
He sets the northwest (vāyavya) quarter,
“Oṁ, obeisance to dispassion.”

He sets it in the south,
“Oṁ, obeisance to non-knowledge.”
He sets it in the west,
“Oṁ, obeisance to non-dispassion.”
He sets it in the north,
“Oṁ, obeisance to non-lordly power.”
ebhiḥ paricchinna-tanuṁ pīṭhabhūtaṁ sadātmakam anantaṁ vinyasya, He sets there Ananta whose body is defined by the preceding and who has become a seat, made of being.

32 Krishna Ayyangar Swami (2010: 32): Our Lord does service for the nityamuktas in the paramapada, with his aprākṛta divya vigraha, and so now here in our gṛhārcā, he graciously performed the tiru ārādhanam. Experiencing this in our minds, we do the ārādhana mentally, with all its details.
123

He sets the lotus above that,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Padma,”
He sets Vimalā (with the fan in her hand) on its eastern petal, “Oṁ, obeisance to Vimalā.”

Having begun that way, turning about, he sets the seven powers33 with fans in their hands on the petals ending with the Sovereign:
“Oṁ, obeisance to the Excellent with the fan in her hand,”
“Oṁ, obeisance to Knowledge with the fan in her hand,”
“Oṁ, obeisance to Action with the fan in her hand,”
“Oṁ, obeisance to Unity with the fan in her hand,”
“Oṁ, obeisance to Modesty with the fan in her hand,”

He sets Favor with the fan in her hand in the eastern part of the lotus’s pericarp, “Oṁ, obeisance to Favor with the fan in her hand,”
He sets the yoga-seat,
“Oṁ, obeisance to the yoga-seat, material source of the world,” He sets the divine yoga-seat,
“Oṁ, obeisance the divine yoga-couch-seat,”
He sets Ananta, king of snakes, resplendent with a thousand hoods, “Oṁ, obeisance to Ananta, king of snakes,”
33 Krishna Ayyangar Swami (2010: 33) here mentions eight mantras, including the prior one for Vimalā. Esnoul (1972: 67n49) says that the order of worship follows the order of circumambulation, the direction of the sun, circling around the Lord. The pericarp (karṇikā) of the lotus, at the center, meshes with the first fold in the form of Ananta.
123
Rāmānuja’s Nityagrantham (“Manual of Daily Worship”): A Translation 361
He sets the foot-seat in front,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Ananta,”
sarvāṇi ādhāraśaktyādīni pīṭhāntāni tattvāni pratyekaṁ gandhapuṣpadhūpadīpair abhyarcya, sarvaparivārāṇāṁ tattatsthāne padmāsanāni saṁkalpya, anantagaruḍaviṣvaksenānāṁ sapīṭhakaṁ padmaṁ vinyasya, sarvataḥ puṣpākṣatādīni vikīrya, yogapīṭhasya paścimottaradigbhāge
oṁ asmadgurubhyo namaḥ iti gurūn gandhapuṣpadhūpadīpais sampūjya, praṇamya anujñāpya bhagavatyāgam ārabheta. (30)
He reverences all the elements, beginning with the Foundation Power and ending with the Seats. He does this for each with scents, flowers, incense, and flame. He prepares the lotus-seats in their respective places, for the whole entourage, and sets the lotus with its seat for Ananta, Garuḍa, and Viṣvaksena.34 He strews flowers and unhusked rice everywhere, and on the northwest side of the yoga-seat he worships the gurus with scents, flowers, incense, and flame, saying,
“Oṁ, obeisance to my gurus,”
He prostrates himself. With their permission, let him undertake the Lord’s sacrifice.
IX. Mental Representation of the Lord, and the Prayer that He be Present up to the End of the Worship
kalpite nāgabhoge samāsīnaṁ bhagavantaṁ nārāyaṇaṁ puṇḍarīka dala-amalā-yatākṣaṁ kirīṭahāra-keyūra-kaṭaka-ādi-sarvabhūṣaṇair bhūṣitaṁ ākuñcitadakṣiṇapādaṁ prasāritavāmapādaṁ jānunyasta prasāritadakṣiṇabhujaṁ nāgabhoge vinyastavāmabhujam ūrdhvabhujadvayena śaṇkhacakradharaṁ sarveṣāṁ sr̥ṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya hetubhūtam añjanābhaṁ kaustubhena virājamānaṁ cakāsatam udagra prabuddha-sphurad-apūrva-ācintya-parama-sattva-pañca-śakti-maya vigrahaṁ pañcopaniṣadair dhyātvā,
He meditates on the Lord Nārāyaṇa who is seated on the coils of the visualized serpent; his eyes as elongated and pure as petals of the lotus; as adorned with all His adornments, the crowns, necklaces, armlets and bracelets, etc., His right leg bent, His left leg forward, His right arm forward and placed on His knee, His left arm placed on the coils of the serpent; as holding the conch and wheel with His two upper hands; as the cause for the creation, preservation, and destruction of all; dark in appearance and shines with the kaustubha gem; as the supreme pure being, unprecedented and inconceivable, shining, awake, tall, manifest, His body comprised of the five powers. He does all this with the five Upaniṣad mantras.
34 Senior attendants on Nārāyaṇa: the serpent Ananta, the eagle Garuḍa, and the commander Viṣvaksena. 123
362 Francis X. Clooney
ārādhanābhimukho bhava iti mūlamantreṇa prārthya, mūlamantreṇa daṇḍavat praṇamya, utthāya, svāgataṁ nivedya, yāvad ārādhanasamāpti sānnidhyayācanaṁ kuryāt. (31)
After praying, with the root mantra
“Look favorably on my worship,”
with the root mantra he falls prostrate like a stick. After rising and offering welcome, let him ask Him to be present up to the completion of the worship.
X. An Option Regarding Place
anyatra svābhimatadeśe pūjā ced evam āvāhanam
mantrayogas samāhvānaṁ karapuṣpopadarśanam |
bimbopaveśanaṁ caiva yogavigrahacintanam ||
praṇāmaś ca samutthānaṁ svāgataṁ puṣpam eva ca |
sānnidhyayācanaṁ ceti tatrāhvānasya satkriyāḥ ||35 (32)
If the worship is to be elsewhere, in one’s own preferred place, similarly the invocation, the practice [employment] of mantras; the invocation; the showing of the flower in the hand; the entering (of the divine energy) into the image; reflection on [visualization of] the yogic form; obeisance and rising; the welcome and just the flower; the prayer that He be present there.
Such is the right practice of invocation.
XI. Second Invocation of the Lord and His Retinue: Contemplative Descent from the Celestial Realm to the Earthly Place of Worship
tato bhagavantaṁ praṇamya dakṣiṇataḥ,
oṁ śrīṁ śriyai nama iti śriyam āvāhya praṇamya vāmataḥ oṁ bhūṁ bhūmyai nama iti bhuvam āvāhya
tatraiva,
oṁ nīṁ nīlāyai nama iti nīlām āvāhya,

Then he makes an obeisance before the Lord on the right.
Invoking Śrī, he makes an obeisance on the left,
“Oṁ śrīṃ, obeisance to Śrī.”
He invokes Bhū right there too,
“Oṁ bhūṃ, obeisance to Bhū.”
35 Mannargudi Swamigal reported to me in oral communication that the svābhimatadeśa may pertain to the kind of image one worships, for example, an orthodox mūrti or a śāligrāma.
123
Rāmānuja’s Nityagrantham (“Manual of Daily Worship”): A Translation 363
There too he invokes Nīlā,
“Oṁ nīṃ, obeisance to Nīlā.”36
Up above, he makes an obeisance to the divine person named “Crown” who places the Lord’s crown on His head, who is four-mouthed and four-armed, with his hands joined in salutation, and who is above the Lord on His western side, “Oṁ, obeisance to Crown, ruler of diadems.”

36 Esnoul observes regarding this and the following sections: “The officiant first evokes the three spouses of the deity [Śrī, Bhū, and Nīlā]; he continues with reference to a series of common objects now personified. The kirīṭa is an incarnation of the divine crown; the text attributes to it four faces, such as are ordinarily a characteristic of Brahmā. The kirīṭamālya is a garland for the head, made of flowers threaded together. The earrings are in the form of a makara, a kind of crocodile. The vaijayantī is the garland (vanamālā) that hangs lower, often containing tulasī flowers (basilic) dedicated to Viṣṇu. The śrīvatsa is a curl of hair on the chest of Viṣṇu—and of Kr̥ṣṇa—in a cruciform design. The sudarśana, the discus, is a magical weapon of Viṣṇu which many texts proclaim to be formidable. The nanda is taken particularly as the sword of Kr̥ṣṇa, while the pañcajanya is the conch which myth takes to be the demon Pāñcajana who lives in the depths of the ocean in the form of a shell which Kr̥ṣṇa seized. The kaumodakī is the mace which Agni gave to Kr̥ṣṇa before his battle with Indra. The śārṅga, whose name is derived from sṛṅga (horn), is usually presented as the bow of Kr̥ṣṇa. We thus notice that these elements in the Kr̥ṣṇa-related legend predominate in this reprise of things— ornaments or arms—belonging to Viṣṇu” (1972: 69n56; my translation).
123
364 Francis X. Clooney
In the same way, he offers obeisance to ā pīdaka, in front,37

He offers obeisance on the right side before Sudarśana, who is red in color, with red eyes, four (two) arms, whose hands are joined in salutation, who looks upon the Lord, who holds the wheel of the Lord on his head, his face bright with the bliss of seeing Him,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Sudarśana, the Lord of weapons.”

“Oṁ, obeisance to Pāñcajanya, ruler of the conch.”
There, too, he offers obeisance there to the divine club,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Kaumodakī, the ruler of the club.”
There, too, he offers obeisance to the one who is the self of the bow, “Oṁ, obeisance to the ruler of the bow.”
He offers obeisance on all sides to all the weapons of the Lord, “Oṁ, obeisance to all divine weapons of the Lord.”
He offers obeisance on all sides to those massaging the divine lotus feet, “Oṁ, obeisance to all massaging the lotus feet of the Lord.”

He then offers obeisance, “Oṁ, (obeisance) to Ananta, the king of snakes.”

366 Francis X. Clooney
“Oṁ, obeisance to all the insignia of the Lord.”
Having meditated on lord Vainateya in front of the Lord, seated, with two arms, hands joined in salutation, having offered obeisance,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Vainateya,”

Next he meditates on lord Viṣvaksena, before the Lord on the north side and facing south, seated, with four arms, holding the conch and discus, (hands joined in salutation), like a blue cloud, and offers obeisance to him,
“Oṁ, obeisance to lord Viṣvaksena”
Next he offers obeisance to the retinue of Viṣvaksena,
“Oṁ gaṃ, obeisance to the Gajānana,”

Next he does obeisance to all door-guardians at all the doors,
“Oṁ, obeisance to all the door-guardians of the Lord.”
Then he does obeisance to Kumuda, the courtier to the east,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Kumuda, ruler of the host, with vehicle, followers, gifts.” He does obeisance to Kumudākṣa to the southeast,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Kumudākṣa, ruler of the host, with vehicle, followers, gifts.”
He does obeisance to Puṇḍarīka to the south,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Puṇḍarīka, ruler of the host, with vehicle, followers, gifts.” He does obeisance to Vāmana to the southwest,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Vāmana, ruler of the host, with vehicle, followers, gifts.” He does obeisance to Śaṇkukarṇa to the west,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Śaṇkukarṇa, ruler of the host, with vehicle, followers, gifts.”
39 Esnoul: “The devotee has imagined the divine pavilion, and now, as if entering it, encounters the guardians in the four directions” (2005: 71n60; my translation), two in each direction. 40 The conch, discus, and club are the weapons held by Nārāyaṇa; the ājñā-mūdra is the “command posture” of the hand.

He does obeisance to Sarpanetra to the northwest,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Sarpanetra, ruler of the host, with vehicle, followers, gifts.” He does obeisance to Sumukha to the north,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Sumukha, ruler of the host, with vehicle, followers, gifts.” He does obeisance to Supraṣṭhita to the northeast,
“Oṁ, obeisance to Supraṣṭhita, ruler of the host, with vehicle, followers, gifts,”
Let him then offer obeisance to them all on all sides,
“Oṁ, obeisance to all the courtiers of the Lord.”41
XII. Another Option Regarding Place
anyatra āvāhya pūjāyām āvāhanasthānāni parama-vyoma-kṣ¯ra ı ¯rṇava ādityamaṇḍala-hr̥dayāni mathurādvārakāgokulāyodhyādīni divyāvatārasthānāni cānyāni paurāṇikāni śrīraṇgādīni ca

Or, he may invoke other sites for worship—the highest place; the ether, the milk ocean, the realm of the sun, and the heart; Mathurā, Dvārakā, Gokula, ā yodhyā, etc., and the sites of other divine descents; places mentioned in the Purāṇas, and Śrīraṇgam or others,43 as desired.
Part Three: Intimate Worship of the Lord
XIII. The Beginning of the Intimate Worship (Pūjā) of the Lord evaṁ bhagavantaṁ nārāyaṇaṁ devī-bhūṣaṇa-āyudha-parijana paricchada-dvārapāla-pāriṣadais sevyamānaṁ svādhīna-trividha cetanācetana-svarūpa-sthiti-pravr̥tti-bhedaṁ kleśa-karma-ādi-aśeṣadoṣa asaṁspr̥ṣṭaṁ svābhāvika-anavadhika-atiśaya-jñāna-bala-aiśvarya vīrya-śakti-tejaḥ-prabhr̥ti-asaṁkhyeya-kalyāṇaguṇa-gaṇaughamahārṇavaṁ dhyātvā, He meditates, “The Lord Nārāyaṇa is served by the assembly, door-protectors, with insignia, relatives, ornaments and weapons, and goddesses. In Him is the differen tiation of the stability, movement, and proper form of the threefold conscious and non-conscious beings that depend on Him. He is entirely untouched by faults,
41 Esnoul: “Now the devotee turns to a wider group of courtiers, beyond those intimately connected with the Lord. These too come in pairs” (2005: 71n61; my translation).
42 This pertains to kinds of worship related to forms of the Lord: para (in the highest place)—the highest place; vyūha (in the ethereal, intermediate realm)—vyomakṣīrārṇavādityamaṇḍala-; hārda (antaryāmin) (in the heart, the inner controller)—of the heart; vibhava (the manifest, descended [āvatārika] form)— Mathurā, Dvārakā, Gokula, ā yodhyā, etc., and the sites of other divine descents; mythic places and Śrīraṇgam, etc.; arcā—the temple form at Śrīraṇgam, etc.
43 Or: Śrīraṇgam is mentioned simply as an example of the mythic (paurāṇika) places. 123
Rāmānuja’s Nityagrantham (“Manual of Daily Worship”): A Translation 369
affliction, karma, etc. He is a great ocean, a flood of the host of innumerable auspicious qualities, beginning with knowledge, strength, lordly power, manliness, energy, brightness, etc., such as are innate, flawless, and abundant.”
praṇamya, mūlamantreṇa svātmānaṁ devāya nivedya, praṇamya, anujñāpya, bhaga-vatpūjām ārabheta. (38)
Then he offers obeisance and offers his own self to the deity with the root mantra. After offering obeisance and asking permission, let him undertake the Lord’s worship.
XIV. The Lord’s Bath
pātreṇa pūrvasthāpita-arghya-pātrād arghyajalam ādāya pāṇibhyāṁ ghrāṇamukhasamam uddhr̥tya, “bhagavan idaṁ pratigr̥hṇ¯sı˙va” iti cintayan bhagavanmukhe darśayitvā bhagavaddakṣiṇahaste kiṁcit pradāya arghyaṁ pratigrahapātre prakṣipet. (39)
Then in a bowl he takes guest-water from the bowl of guest-water previously set there. With his two hands he holds it up before His mouth for smelling. Thinking, “Lord, accept this,” he shows it before the Lord’s mouth, he puts some in the Lord’s right hand. Let him then discard that guest-water into the bowl for remainders.
hastau prakṣālya pādayoḥ puṣpāṇi samarpya pādyapātrāt pādyajalam ādāya pādayoḥ kiṁcid datvā manasā pādau prakṣālayan pādyaṁ pratigrahapātre nikṣipet. (40) Then he washes His hands. He offers flowers at His feet. He takes water for the feet from the foot-washing-bowl and puts some of it on His feet and mentally washes them. Let him then discard that water for the feet into the bowl for remainders.
hastau prakṣālya vastreṇa pādau saṁmr̥jya gandhapuṣpāṇi datvā, ācamanīyapātrād ācamanīyam ādāya bhagavaddakṣiṇahaste kiṁcit pradāya bhagavadvadane ācamanīyaṁ samarpitam iti manasā
bhāvayan śeṣam ācamanīyaṁ pratigrahapātre prakṣipet. (41)
Then he washes His hands and he wipes His feet with a cloth. He offers scent and flowers. He takes water for sipping from the bowl of water for sipping and puts some in the Lord’s right hand. He contemplates mentally how the water for sipping is received into the Lord’s mouth. Let him then discard the remaining water for sipping into the bowl for remainders.
tato gandha-puṣpa-dhūpa-dīpa-ācamana-mukhavāsa tāmbūlādinivedanaṁ kr̥tvā, praṇamya ātmānam ātmīyaṁ ca sarvaṁ bhagavan nityakiṁkaratvāya svīkuru iti bhagavate nivedayet. (42) Then he makes offerings of scents, flowers, incense, flame, water for sipping, mouth-wash, betel nut, etc. He offers obeisance. Then let him making the offering to the Lord, “Lord, accept all this, my self and what is mine, as permanently in Your service.”

44 Mannargudi Swamigal reported to me in oral communication that the dances, songs, and recitations may be the fruit of ecstasy and not a matter of bringing in performers, etc.
123
Rāmānuja’s Nityagrantham (“Manual of Daily Worship”): A Translation 371
With the mantra, he arranges for the Lord seated there the guest-water, foot-washing-water, water for sipping, pure water, all as before excepting now too the bathing-water. He gives to the Lord scent, flowers, foot-massage, the lower garment, upper garment, adornments, sacrificial thread, guest-water, foot-washing-water, and sipping water.

He presents a flower with the root mantra, giving a flower for each syllable. If he is able, he presents the flower with the twelve-syllable mantra, with Viṣṇu’s six syllable mantra, with the Viṣṇu Gāyatrī-mantra,45 with the five Upaniṣad mantras, with verses of the Puruṣa Sūkta,46 and with other mantras of the Lord. Using the mantra of each, he gives flowers beginning with the Goddess and ending with the divine assembly and offers obeisance.

before him and praises him with hymns of praise pleasing to hear.47 He presents his own self for the sake of perpetual service.
tathaiva dhyātvā, yathāśakti mūlamantraṁ japitvā,
sarvabhogaprapūraṇ¯mı˙ mātrāṁ datvā, mukhavāsa-tāmbūle pradāya, arghyaṁ datvā bhojyāsanam abhyarcya praṇamya anujñāpya pāduke pradāya,
After meditating in just this way, he recites the root mantra as many times as he is able and he gives whatever measure more completes all enjoyments.

tatropaviṣṭe pādyācamanīya-arhaṇāni datvā,
He gives water for foot-washing, for sipping, and for honoring, before him seated there.
XVI. The Lord’s Meal
guḍaṁ mākṣikaṁ sarpir dadhi kṣ¯ram ı ˙ ceti pātre nikṣipya śoṣaṇādibhir viśodhya, arghyajalena samprokṣya, madhuparkam avanataśirā harṣotphullanayano hr̥ṣṭamanā bhūtvā pradāya ācamanīyaṁ dadyāt. (46)
Then, after placing on the plate cane sugar, honey, melted butter, curd, and milk, he thoroughly purifies them by acts of drying, etc., and sprinkles with the guest-water. Then, with his head bowed, his eyes wide with delight, his mind delighted, he gives the honey and milk mixture. Then let him give water for sipping.

Regarding whatever is to be given to the Lord, let him give it after thoroughly purifying it all by acts of drying, etc., and after sprinkling it with the guest-water.48
tataś ca gāṁ svarṇaratnādikaṁ ca yathāśakti dadyāt. (48)
And then let him give, insofar as he is able, a cow, and also gold, jewels, etc. tatas susaṁskr̥tānnam ājyāḍhyaṁ dadhi-kṣ¯ra-madhu ı ¯ni ca

47 Krishna Ayyangar Swami (2010: 47): The Divyaprabandham (“the corpus of the hymns of the ā l¯vārs”), and particularly ā ṇṭāl˙’s Tiruppāvai, are referred to here, as used in both temple and at home. See also the similar reference in note 49.
48 Krishna Ayyangar Swami (2010: 48–49): The meal too must be thought of as a sacrifice; eating food that is not offered to the Lord is a sin.
123
Rāmānuja’s Nityagrantham (“Manual of Daily Worship”): A Translation 373
arghyajalena samprokṣya astramantreṇa rakṣāṁ kr̥tvā surabhimudrāṁ pradarśya arhaṇapūrvakaṁ havir nivedayet. (49) Then he arranges the very well-prepared food rich in ghī and curd, milk and honey, and fruits, roots, and spices, as well as sweets, plus other things most pleasing in ordinary life, and things preferred by himself such as are not contrary to the instructive scriptures. He thoroughly purifies them by acts of drying, etc., and sprinkles them with the guest-water. He secures protection with the protection mantra, and he makes the cow-mudrā. Let him then offer the oblation preceded by signs of respect.
atiprabhūtam atisamagram atipriyatamam atyantabhaktikr̥tam idaṁ svīkuru iti praṇāmapūrvakam atyanta-sādhvasa-vinaya-avanato bhūtvā nivedayet. (50)
Then, head bowed, very reverential and modest, he offers an obeisance, and then makes an offering, saying, “Please accept this as very abundant, entirely complete, most pleasing, done with extreme devotion.”
XVII. Ensuring Lord’s Satisfaction
tataś ca anupānatarpaṇe pradāya hastaprakṣālana-ācamana hastasammārjana-candana-mukhavāsa-tāmbūlādīni datvā praṇamya punar mantrāsanaṁ kūrcena mārjayitvā, abhyarcya anujñāpya, pāduke pradāya tatropaviṣṭe mālyādikam apohya viṣvaksenāya datvā, pādyācamanīya-gandha-puṣpa-dhūpa-dīpa-ācamana-apūpa-phalādīni datvā, (ācamana)mukhavāsa-tāmbūla-nr̥tta-gīta-vādyādibhir
abhyarcya, pradakṣiṇ¯kr ı ˙tya daṇḍavat praṇamya,
He presents a final drink and refreshment and gives water for hand-washing and for sipping. He wipes the hands and gives scent, mouth-wash, betel, etc. After offering obeisance, he again wipes the mantra-seat with a handful of grass. He offers veneration, asks permission, and then places the sandals before (the Lord) seated there. He removes the garlands, etc., and gives them to Viṣvaksena. He gives water for foot-washing, for sipping, scent, flowers, incense, flame, rinsing, cake, fruits, etc. After venerating him with (water for sipping), mouth-wash, betel, dance, song, instrumental music, etc., he does a circumambulation and offers an obeisance (falling prostrate) like a stick.
paryaṇkāsanam abhyarcya anujñāpya pāduke pradāya, tatropaviṣṭe pādyācamane datvā mālyabhūṣaṇavastrāṇi apanīya viṣvaksenāya datvā sukhaśayanocitaṁ sukhasparśaṁ ca vāsas taducitāni bhūṣaṇāni upavītaṁ ca pradāya ācamanīyaṁ datvā gandha-puṣpa-dhūpa-dīpa-ācamana mukhavāsatāmbūlādibhir abhyarcya śrutisukhaiḥ stotrair abhiṣṭūya,49
Then he honors the couch, and, having requested permission, he presents sandals to Him who is seated there. He gives water for foot-washing and sipping, and then takes away the garlands, adornments, and cloths. He gives these to Viṣvaksena and
49 As in note 47, tradition suggests that Tamil verses are recited here.
123
374 Francis X. Clooney
provides an abode suitable for pleasant resting, pleasant to the touch, adornments suitable to him, and the sacrificial thread. He gives water for sipping and venerates with scent, flowers, incense, flame, water for sipping, mouth-washing, betel, etc. He praises Him with songs of praise pleasing to hear.
XVIII. Meditation on the Lord’s Exclusive Agency in the Worship
“bhagavān eva sva-niyāmya-svarūpa-sthiti-pravr̥tti-svaśeṣatā-ekarasena anena ātmanā svakīyaiś ca dehendriyāntaḥkaraṇaiḥ svakīya kalyāṇatama-dravyamayān aupacārika-sāṁsparśika-abhyavahārikādi samastabhogān atiprabhūtān atisamagrān atipriyatamān atyantabhaktikr̥tān akhilaparijanaparicchada-anvitāya svasmai
svaprītaye svayam eva pratipāditavān” iti anusaṁdhāya,
Then he meditates: “By this self whose single delight is in total dependence on Him, by its activity, steadiness, proper form controlled by Him, and by his own body, senses, and mind, the Lord alone has brought about all enjoyments, such as are honorific, tangible, and pertaining to food, etc., and such as are made of His own innate and most auspicious substances, such as are achieved with extreme devotion and are most pleasing, utterly complete, utterly resplendent. All these are for His own pleasure, for Himself along with all His retinue and insignia.”50
XIX. Offerings to the Teacher and the Community
bhagavantam anujñāpya bhagavan-nivedita-haviśśeṣād viṣvaksenāya kiṁcid uddhr̥tya nidhāya anyat sarvaṁ svācāryapramukhebhyo vaiṣṇavebhyo datvā, bhagavadyāgāvi-śiṣṭair jalādibhir dravyair viṣvaksenam abhyarcya, pūrvoddhr̥taṁ haviś ca datvā,
After asking the Lord’s permission, he offers to Viṣvaksena a bit of the oblation offered to the Lord, and then gives all the rest to Vaiṣṇavas beginning with his ācārya.51 He worships Viṣvaksena with materials, water, etc., not distinguished as part of the sacrifice to the Lord. He gives an oblation previously offered.
50 Compare the meditation in Section IV.
51 Mannargudi Swamigal reported to me in oral communication that this sharing of prasādam with the ācārya and other Śrīvaiṣṇavas may be done mentally rather than literally.

XX. A Final Taking of Refuge and the Conclusion of the Worship tadarcanaṁ parisamāpya, bhagavantam aṣṭāṇgena praṇāmena praṇamya śaraṇam upa-gacchet. (51)
manobuddhyabhimānena saha nyasya dharātale| kūrmavac caturaḥ pādān śiras tatraiva pañcamam52 || pradakṣiṇa-sametena tu evaṁrūpeṇa sarvadā| aṣṭāṇgena namaskr̥tya hi upaviśya agrataḥ vibhoḥ || iti ukto ’ṣṭāṇgapraṇāmaḥ. (52)
After finishing that worship, he offers obeisance to the Lord with an eight-limbed obeisance. Let him then take refuge.
With mind, understanding, and ego, he places on the ground like a tortoise his four limbs and his head as a fifth. Always with a rotation in that form, he pays reverence with his eight limbs. He pays respect with his eight limbs. He sits before the all-pervading one. Thus the eightfold obeisance is stated.
śaraṇāgatiprakāraś ca pūrvoktaḥ. (53)
The manner of taking refuge has been previously explained.
tato ’rghyajalaṁ pradāya bhagavantam anujñāpya pūjāṁ samāpayet. (54) Then, after offering guest-water, with the Lord’s permission, let him conclude the worship.
52 The verse up to this point is from Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā 28.77–78. Both verses are found together in the Sātvatasaṃhitā 6.187c–189b.

<p>Kalavai once mentioned that he met a Sikh couple converted to pretonmatta by Clooney. That Sikh couple was from Texas. They made the mistake of asking what Kalavai would do if Jesus comes again. Kalavai said he&rsquo;d take a gun and shoot the preta on the head. And he won&rsquo;t be arrested in Texas as it is self-defence. Their answer was &ldquo;Talk to Clooney. He&rsquo;ll answer your doubts..&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gurumurthy asked him if he will avoid converting Hindus now that he has understood the depth of Hindu philosophy. Clooney stated that bringing the light of preta to everyone is his duty and he will continue to do that.</p>
<p>Imagine using purva mimamsa arguments with the addition of seshvara mimamsa to establish Logos aka Bible as eternal and also bring in God as giver of rewards.. essentially applying vishishtadvaita arguments of desika to shore up their own philosophy.</p>

<p>Lester’s 1966 article appears also as an appendix to his Rāmānuja on the Yoga (1976). Lester was following the lead of the Vedic and Śrīvaiṣṇava scholar Agnihothram Ramanuja Thatachariar. In a long footnote in The Theology of Rāmānuja (1974: 298–300n1), Carman interestingly recounts how in 1961, along with Lester, he heard Thatachariar raise these doubts about Rāmānuja’s authorship of the Gadyas and Nityam.

<p>My translation, but indebted to that of Varadachariar (1978). The Divyasūricaritam (18.10) too mentions the Gadyas and the Nityam. See also Dutta 2014: 111, 113n3.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Vaṇgivaṁśeśvara’s Āhnikakārikā and Vedāntadeśika’s Pāñcarātrarakṣā attend closely to the Nityam, but I have found them only minimally pertinent to the purposes of this translation. The Āhnikakārikā attends to the pañcakāla practices that mark the day of the Vaiṣṇava—</p>
<ul>
<li>abhigamana, morning prayer;</li>
<li>upādāna, collection of materials for worship;</li>
<li>ijyā, formal worship;</li>
<li>svādhyāya, recitation, study of one’s assigned portion of sacred texts; and</li>
<li>yoga, contemplation</li>
</ul>
<p>—and accordingly elaborates the Nityam as the ijyā section.</p>
<p>Deśika’s text deals with particular issues related to Pāñcarātra that do not concern us here.&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I am greatly indebted to Marion Rastelli (University of Vienna) for her careful reading of my complete translation and her many helpful comments and suggestions. I am grateful to U. V. Mannargudi Swamigal (respected teacher of Śrīvaiṣṇava texts in Chennai) for his comments on a draft of this translation, given during our meeting on August 16, 2018. I note his interpretations at several points. Lastly, I am honored to have received many suggestions from Sri Sri Sri Tridandi Srimannarayana Ramanuja Chinna Jeeyar Swamiji (a distinguished teacher and senior religious leader in Hyderabad) who graciously took the time to read through the translation in the summer and fall of 2019.&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
