      <description>If one is interested to prepare Srichurnam on his own, here is the method to prepare it. This method of preparing Srichurnam has been carried forward for generations:

My son had lead poison from yellow-srichUrNam that was store bought (sent from India).
Discovery He was chewing on paint chips on a visit to India. So when we went back I got a preventive lead test done. Came positive. We thought it was the paint. They did a second test in 2-3 weeks and while the number went down, it didn&amp;rsquo;t go down as much as expected.</description>
