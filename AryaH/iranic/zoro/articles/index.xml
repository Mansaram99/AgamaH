      <description>&amp;hellip; The fravašis thus help in war, and they give aid also in peace. They are &amp;ldquo;givers of &amp;hellip; a boon to the eager, of health to the sick, givers of good fortune to him who invokes them, worshipping, satisfying, bringing offerings” (Yt.13.24). In fact, like the Indian pitaras, the fravašis receive reverence and supplication in very much the same way as the gods themselves, and are held to have the same capacity to answer prayers and bestow boons.</description>

Zoroastrianism (Mazdayasna) must be the only form of &amp;ldquo;monotheism&amp;rdquo; where the creator diety (Ahura Mazda) offers sacrifices to his own created beings. (Yasht 15) Or where the one God (Ahura Mazda) says that his own created beings are as worthy of worship as himself (Yasht 10). I find it very funny how so many modern day westernized Parsis or Iranian Shia converts actually believe &amp;ldquo;Zoroastrianism was the first monotheism!</description>

      <description>We worship all the Yazats &amp;amp; follow asha/arta &amp;amp; strive for the destruction of druj &amp;amp; agents of ahriman alongside ahriman himself.
In medieval Sanskrit texts written by Parsis in India, that&amp;rsquo;s how it is represented. In English texts written under the British, it is monotheistic+&amp;ldquo;Aryan&amp;rdquo;, best of both. Same with contemporary Persian texts. In contemporary English texts written for Europeans, it is uber-Pagan.</description>
